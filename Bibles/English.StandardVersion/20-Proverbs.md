@1 The proverbs of Solomon, son of David, king of Israel:
@2 To know wisdom and instruction, to understand words of insight,
@3 to receive instruction in wise dealing, in righteousness, justice , and equity;
@4 to give prudence to the simple, knowledge and discretion to the youth —
@5 Let the wise hear and increase in learning, and the one who understands obtain guidance,
@6 to understand a proverb and a saying, the words of the wise and their riddles.
@7 The fear of the Lord is the beginning of knowledge; fools despise wisdom and instruction.
@8 Hear , my son , your father’s instruction, and forsake not your mother’s teaching,
@9 for they are a graceful garland for your head and pendants for your neck.
@10 My son, if sinners entice you, do not consent.
@11 If they say, Come with us, let us lie in wait for blood; let us ambush the innocent without reason;
@12 like Sheol let us swallow them alive, and whole , like those who go down to the pit;
@13 we shall find all precious goods, we shall fill our houses with plunder;
@14 throw in your lot among us; we will all have one purse —
@15 my son, do not walk in the way with them; hold back your foot from their paths,
@16 for their feet run to evil, and they make haste to shed blood.
@17 For in vain is a net spread in the sight of any bird,
@18 but these men lie in wait for their own blood; they set an ambush for their own lives.
@19 Such are the ways of everyone who is greedy for unjust gain; it takes away the life of its possessors.
@20 Wisdom cries aloud in the street, in the markets she raises her voice;
@21 at the head of the noisy streets she cries out; at the entrance of the city gates she speaks:
@22 How long , O simple ones , will you love being simple? How long will scoffers delight in their scoffing and fools hate knowledge?
@23 If you turn at my reproof, behold , I will pour out my spirit to you; I will make my words known to you.
@24 Because I have called and you refused to listen, have stretched out my hand and no one has heeded,
@25 because you have ignored all my counsel would have none of my reproof,
@26 I also will laugh at your calamity; I will mock when terror strikes you,
@27 when terror strikes you like a storm and your calamity comes like a whirlwind, when distress and anguish come upon you.
@28 Then they will call upon me, but I will not answer; they will seek me diligently but will not find me.
@29 Because they hated knowledge and did not choose the fear of the Lord,
@30 would have none of my counsel and despised all my reproof,
@31 therefore they shall eat the fruit of their way, and have their fill of their own devices.
@32 For the simple are killed by their turning away, and the complacency of fools destroys them;
@33 but whoever listens to me will dwell secure and will be at ease, without dread of disaster.

@34 My son, if you receive my words and treasure up my commandments with you,
@35 making your ear attentive to wisdom and inclining your heart to understanding;
@36 yes, if you call out for insight and raise your voice for understanding,
@37 if you seek it like silver and search for it as for hidden treasures,
@38 then you will understand the fear of the Lord and find the knowledge of God.
@39 For the Lord gives wisdom; from his mouth come knowledge and understanding;
@40 he stores up sound wisdom for the upright; he is a shield to those who walk in integrity,
@41 guarding the paths of justice and watching over the way of his saints.
@42 Then you will understand righteousness and justice and equity, every good path;
@43 for wisdom will come into your heart, and knowledge will be pleasant to your soul;
@44 discretion will watch over you, understanding will guard you,
@45 delivering you from the way of evil, from men of perverted speech,
@46 who forsake the paths of uprightness to walk in the ways of darkness,
@47 who rejoice in doing evil and delight in the perverseness of evil,
@48 men whose paths are crooked, and who are devious in their ways.
@49 So you will be delivered from the forbidden woman, from the adulteress with her smooth words,
@50 who forsakes the companion of her youth and forgets the covenant of her God;
@51 for her house sinks down to death, and her paths to the departed;
@52 none who go to her come back, nor do they regain the paths of life.
@53 So you will walk in the way of the good and keep to the paths of the righteous.
@54 For the upright will inhabit the land, and those with integrity will remain in it,
@55 but the wicked will be cut off from the land, and the treacherous will be rooted out of it.

# 3
@56 My son , do not forget my teaching, but let your heart keep my commandments,
@57 for length of days and years of life and peace they will add to you.
@58 Let not steadfast love and faithfulness forsake you; bind them around your neck; write them on the tablet of your heart.
@59 So you will find favor and good success in the sight of God and man.
@60 Trust in the Lord with all your heart, and do not lean on your own understanding.
@61 In all your ways acknowledge him, and he will make straight your paths.
@62 Be not wise in your own eyes; fear the Lord , and turn away from evil.
@63 It will be healing to your flesh and refreshment to your bones.
@64 Honor the Lord with your wealth and with the firstfruits of all your produce;
@65 then your barns will be filled with plenty, and your vats will be bursting with wine.
@66 My son , do not despise the Lord ’s discipline or be weary of his reproof,
@67 for the Lord reproves him whom he loves, as a father the son in whom he delights.
@68 Blessed is the one who finds wisdom, and the one who gets understanding,
@69 for the gain from her is better than gain from silver and her profit better than gold.
@70 She is more precious than jewels, and nothing you desire can compare with her.
@71 Long life is in her right hand; in her left hand are riches and honor.
@72 Her ways are ways of pleasantness, and all her paths are peace.
@73 She is a tree of life to those who lay hold of her; those who hold her fast are called blessed.
@74 The Lord by wisdom founded the earth; by understanding he established the heavens;
@75 by his knowledge the deeps broke open, and the clouds drop down the dew.
@76 My son, do not lose sight of these— keep sound wisdom and discretion,
@77 and they will be life for your soul and adornment for your neck.
@78 Then you will walk on your way securely, and your foot will not stumble.
@79 If you lie down , you will not be afraid; when you lie down, your sleep will be sweet.
@80 Do not be afraid of sudden terror or of the ruin of the wicked, when it comes,
@81 for the Lord will be your confidence and will keep your foot from being caught.
@82 Do not withhold good from those to whom it is due, when it is in your power to do it.
@83 Do not say to your neighbor, Go , and come again, tomorrow I will give it —when you have it with you.
@84 Do not plan evil against your neighbor, who dwells trustingly beside you.
@85 Do not contend with a man for no reason, when he has done you no harm.
@86 Do not envy a man of violence and do not choose any of his ways,
@87 for the devious person is an abomination to the Lord, but the upright are in his confidence.
@88 The Lord ’s curse is on the house of the wicked, but he blesses the dwelling of the righteous.
@89 Toward the scorners he is scornful, but to the humble he gives favor.
@90 The wise will inherit honor, but fools get disgrace.

@91 Hear , O sons , a father’s instruction, and be attentive , that you may gain insight,
@92 for I give you good precepts; do not forsake my teaching.
@93 When I was a son with my father, tender, the only one in the sight of my mother,
@94 he taught me and said to me, Let your heart hold fast my words; keep my commandments , and live.
@95 Get wisdom; get insight; do not forget , and do not turn away from the words of my mouth.
@96 Do not forsake her, and she will keep you; love her, and she will guard you.
@97 The beginning of wisdom is this: Get wisdom, and whatever you get, get insight.
@98 Prize her highly , and she will exalt you; she will honor you if you embrace her.
@99 She will place on your head a graceful garland; she will bestow on you a beautiful crown.
@100 Hear, my son , and accept my words, that the years of your life may be many.
@101 I have taught you the way of wisdom; I have led you in the paths of uprightness.
@102 When you walk, your step will not be hampered, and if you run , you will not stumble.
@103 Keep hold of instruction ; do not let go; guard her, for she is your life.
@104 Do not enter the path of the wicked, and do not walk in the way of the evil.
@105 Avoid it; do not go on it; turn away from it and pass on.
@106 For they cannot sleep unless they have done wrong; they are robbed of sleep unless they have made someone stumble.
@107 For they eat the bread of wickedness and drink the wine of violence.
@108 But the path of the righteous is like the light of dawn, which shines brighter and brighter until full day.
@109 The way of the wicked is like darkness; they do not know over what they stumble.
@110 My son , be attentive to my words; incline your ear to my sayings.
@111 Let them not escape from your sight; keep them within your heart.
@112 For they are life to those who find them, and healing to all their flesh.
@113 Keep your heart with all vigilance, for from it flow the springs of life.
@114 Put away from you crooked speech, and put devious talk far from you.
@115 Let your eyes look directly forward, and your gaze be straight before you.
@116 Ponder the path of your feet; then all your ways will be sure.
@117 Do not swerve to the right or to the left; turn your foot away from evil.

# 5
@118 My son , be attentive to my wisdom; incline your ear to my understanding,
@119 that you may keep discretion, and your lips may guard knowledge.
@120 For the lips of a woman drip honey, and her speech is smoother than oil,
@121 but in the end she is bitter as wormwood, sharp as a two-edged sword.
@122 Her feet go down to death; her steps follow the path to Sheol;
@123 she does not ponder the path of life; her ways wander , and she does not know it.
@124 And now , O sons, listen to me, and do not depart from the words of my mouth.
@125 Keep your way far from her, and do not go near the door of her house,
@126 lest you give your honor to others and your years to the merciless,
@127 lest strangers take their fill of your strength, and your labors go to the house of a foreigner,
@128 and at the end of your life you groan, when your flesh and body are consumed,
@129 and you say, How I hated discipline, and my heart despised reproof!
@130 I did not listen to the voice of my teachers or incline my ear to my instructors.
@131 I am at the brink of utter ruin in the assembled congregation.
@132 Drink water from your own cistern, flowing water from your own well.
@133 Should your springs be scattered abroad, streams of water in the streets?
@134 Let them be for yourself alone, and not for strangers with you.
@135 Let your fountain be blessed, and rejoice in the wife of your youth,
@136 a lovely deer , a graceful doe. Let her breasts fill you at all times with delight; be intoxicated always in her love.
@137 Why should you be intoxicated , my son , with a forbidden woman and embrace the bosom of an adulteress?
@138 For a man’s ways are before the eyes of the Lord, and he ponders all his paths.
@139 The iniquities of the wicked ensnare him, and he is held fast in the cords of his sin.
@140 He dies for lack of discipline, and because of his great folly he is led astray.

# 6
@141 My son, if you have security for your neighbor, have given your pledge for a stranger,
@142 if you are snared in the words of your mouth, caught in the words of your mouth,
@143 then do this , my son , and save yourself, for you have come into the hand of your neighbor: go, hasten, and plead urgently with your neighbor.
@144 Give your eyes no sleep and your eyelids no slumber;
@145 save yourself like a gazelle from the hand of the hunter, like a bird from the hand of the fowler.
@146 Go to the ant , O sluggard; consider her ways , and be wise.
@147 Without having any chief, officer , or ruler,
@148 she prepares her bread in summer and gathers her food in harvest.
@149 How long will you lie there, O sluggard? When will you arise from your sleep?
@150 A little sleep , a little slumber, a little folding of the hands to rest,
@151 and poverty will come upon you like a robber, and want like an armed man.
@152 A worthless person , a wicked man, goes about with crooked speech,
@153 winks with his eyes, signals with his feet, points with his finger,
@154 with perverted heart devises evil, continually sowing discord;
@155 therefore calamity will come upon him suddenly; in a moment he will be broken beyond healing.
@156 There are six things that the Lord hates, seven that are an abomination to him:
@157 haughty eyes, a lying tongue, and hands that shed innocent blood,
@158 a heart that devises wicked plans, feet that make haste to run to evil,
@159 a false witness who breathes out lies, and one who sows discord among brothers.
@160 My son, keep your father’s commandment, and forsake not your mother’s teaching.
@161 Bind them on your heart always; tie them around your neck.
@162 When you walk , they will lead you; when you lie down , they will watch over you; and when you awake , they will talk with you.
@163 For the commandment is a lamp and the teaching a light, and the reproofs of discipline are the way of life,
@164 to preserve you from the evil woman, from the smooth tongue of the adulteress.
@165 Do not desire her beauty in your heart, and do not let her capture you with her eyelashes;
@166 for the price of a prostitute is only a loaf of bread, but a married woman hunts down a precious life.
@167 Can a man carry fire next to his chest and his clothes not be burned?
@168 Or can one walk on hot coals and his feet not be scorched?
@169 So is he who goes in to his neighbor’s wife; none who touches her will go unpunished.
@170 People do not despise a thief if he steals to satisfy his appetite when he is hungry,
@171 but if he is caught , he will pay sevenfold; he will give all the goods of his house.
@172 He who commits adultery lacks sense; he who does it destroys himself.
@173 He will get wounds and dishonor, and his disgrace will not be wiped away.
@174 For jealousy makes a man furious, and he will not spare when he takes revenge.
@175 He will accept no compensation; he will refuse though you multiply gifts.

# 7
@176 My son, keep my words and treasure up my commandments with you;
@177 keep my commandments and live; keep my teaching as the apple of your eye;
@178 bind them on your fingers; write them on the tablet of your heart.
@179 Say to wisdom, You are my sister, and call insight your intimate friend,
@180 to keep you from the forbidden woman, from the adulteress with her smooth words.
@181 For at the window of my house I have looked out through my lattice,
@182 and I have seen among the simple, I have perceived among the youths, a young man lacking sense,
@183 passing along the street near her corner, taking the road to her house
@184 in the twilight , in the evening, at the time of night and darkness.
@185 And behold , the woman meets him, dressed as a prostitute, wily of heart.
@186 She is loud and wayward; her feet do not stay at home;
@187 now in the street, now in the market, at every corner she lies in wait.
@188 She seizes him and kisses him, and with bold face she says to him,
@189 I had to offer sacrifices, and today I have paid my vows;
@190 so now I have come out to meet you, to seek you eagerly, and I have found you.
@191 I have spread my couch with coverings, colored linens from Egyptian linen;
@192 I have perfumed my bed with myrrh, aloes , and cinnamon.
@193 Come , let us take our fill of love till morning; let us delight ourselves with love.
@194 For my husband is not at home; he has gone on a long journey;
@195 he took a bag of money with him; at full moon he will come home.
@196 With much seductive speech she persuades him; with her smooth talk she compels him.
@197 All at once he follows her, as an ox goes to the slaughter, or as a stag is caught fast
@198 till an arrow pierces its liver; as a bird rushes into a snare; he does not know that it will cost him his life.
@199 And now , O sons, listen to me, and be attentive to the words of my mouth.
@200 Let not your heart turn aside to her ways; do not stray into her paths,
@201 for many a victim has she laid low, and all her slain are a mighty throng.
@202 Her house is the way to Sheol, going down to the chambers of death.

# 8
@203 Does not wisdom call? Does not understanding raise her voice?
@204 On the heights beside the way, at the crossroads she takes her stand;
@205 beside the gates in front of the town, at the entrance of the portals she cries aloud:
@206 To you, O men , I call, and my cry is to the children of man.
@207 O simple ones, learn prudence; O fools, learn sense.
@208 Hear, for I will speak noble things, and from my lips will come what is right,
@209 for my mouth will utter truth; wickedness is an abomination to my lips.
@210 All the words of my mouth are righteous; there is nothing twisted or crooked in them.
@211 They are all straight to him who understands, and right to those who find knowledge.
@212 Take my instruction instead of silver, and knowledge rather than choice gold,
@213 for wisdom is better than jewels, and all that you may desire cannot compare with her.
@214 I, wisdom, dwell with prudence, and I find knowledge and discretion.
@215 The fear of the Lord is hatred of evil. Pride and arrogance and the way of evil and perverted speech I hate.
@216 I have counsel and sound wisdom; I have insight; I have strength.
@217 By me kings reign, and rulers decree what is just;
@218 by me princes rule, and nobles, all who govern justly.
@219 I love those who love me, and those who seek me diligently find me.
@220 Riches and honor are with me, enduring wealth and righteousness.
@221 My fruit is better than gold , even fine gold, and my yield than choice silver.
@222 I walk in the way of righteousness, in the paths of justice,
@223 granting an inheritance to those who love me, and filling their treasuries.
@224 The Lord possessed me at the beginning of his work, the first of his acts of old.
@225 Ages ago I was set up, at the first, before the beginning of the earth.
@226 When there were no depths I was brought forth, when there were no springs abounding with water.
@227 Before the mountains had been shaped, before the hills , I was brought forth,
@228 before he had made the earth with its fields, or the first of the dust of the world.
@229 When he established the heavens, I was there; when he drew a circle on the face of the deep,
@230 when he made firm the skies above, when he established the fountains of the deep,
@231 when he assigned to the sea its limit, so that the waters might not transgress his command, when he marked out the foundations of the earth,
@232 then I was beside him , like a master workman, and I was daily his delight, rejoicing before him always,
@233 rejoicing in his inhabited world and delighting in the children of man.
@234 And now, O sons, listen to me: blessed are those who keep my ways.
@235 Hear instruction and be wise, and do not neglect it.
@236 Blessed is the one who listens to me, watching daily at my gates, waiting beside my doors.
@237 For whoever finds me finds life and obtains favor from the Lord,
@238 but he who fails to find me injures himself; all who hate me love death.

@239 Wisdom has built her house; she has hewn her seven pillars.
@240 She has slaughtered her beasts ; she has mixed her wine; she has also set her table.
@241 She has sent out her young women to call from the highest places in the town,
@242 Whoever is simple , let him turn in here! To him who lacks sense she says,
@243 Come, eat of my bread and drink of the wine I have mixed.
@244 Leave your simple ways, and live, and walk in the way of insight.
@245 Whoever corrects a scoffer gets himself abuse, and he who reproves a wicked man incurs injury.
@246 Do not reprove a scoffer, or he will hate you; reprove a wise man , and he will love you.
@247 Give instruction to a wise man , and he will be still wiser; teach a righteous man, and he will increase in learning.
@248 The fear of the Lord is the beginning of wisdom, and the knowledge of the Holy One is insight.
@249 For by me your days will be multiplied, and years will be added to your life.
@250 If you are wise , you are wise for yourself; if you scoff , you alone will bear it.
@251 The woman Folly is loud; she is seductive and knows nothing.
@252 She sits at the door of her house; she takes a seat on the highest places of the town,
@253 calling to those who pass by, who are going straight on their way,
@254 Whoever is simple , let him turn in here! And to him who lacks sense she says,
@255 Stolen water is sweet, and bread eaten in secret is pleasant.
@256 But he does not know that the dead are there, that her guests are in the depths of Sheol.

@673 Who has woe? Who has sorrow? Who has strife? Who has complaining? Who has wounds without cause? Who has redness of eyes?
@674 Those who tarry long over wine; those who go to try mixed wine.
@675 Do not look at wine when it is red, when it sparkles in the cup and goes down smoothly.
@676 In the end it bites like a serpent and stings like an adder.
@677 Your eyes will see strange things, and your heart utter perverse things.
@678 You will be like one who lies down in the midst of the sea, like one who lies on the top of a mast.
@679 They struck me, you will say, but I was not hurt; they beat me, but I did not feel it. When shall I awake? I must have another drink.

@680 Be not envious of evil men, nor desire to be with them,
@681 for their hearts devise violence, and their lips talk of trouble.
@682 By wisdom a house is built, and by understanding it is established;
@683 by knowledge the rooms are filled with all precious and pleasant riches.
@684 A wise man is full of strength, and a man of knowledge enhances his might,
@685 for by wise guidance you can wage your war, and in abundance of counselors there is victory.
@686 Wisdom is too high for a fool; in the gate he does not open his mouth.
@687 Whoever plans to do evil will be called a schemer.
@688 The devising of folly is sin, and the scoffer is an abomination to mankind.
@689 If you faint in the day of adversity, your strength is small.
@690 Rescue those who are being taken away to death; hold back those who are stumbling to the slaughter.
@691 If you say, Behold , we did not know this, does not he who weighs the heart perceive it? Does not he who keeps watch over your soul know it, and will he not repay man according to his work?
@692 My son, eat honey, for it is good, and the drippings of the honeycomb are sweet to your taste.
@693 Know that wisdom is such to your soul; if you find it, there will be a future, and your hope will not be cut off.
@694 Lie not in wait as a wicked man against the dwelling of the righteous; do no violence to his home;
@695 for the righteous falls seven times and rises again, but the wicked stumble in times of calamity.
@696 Do not rejoice when your enemy falls, and let not your heart be glad when he stumbles,
@697 lest the Lord see it and be displeased, and turn away his anger from him.
@698 Fret not yourself because of evildoers, and be not envious of the wicked,
@699 for the evil man has no future; the lamp of the wicked will be put out.
@700 My son, fear the Lord and the king, and do not join with those who do otherwise,
@701 for disaster will arise suddenly from them, and who knows the ruin that will come from them both?
@702 These also are sayings of the wise. Partiality in judging is not good.
@703 Whoever says to the wicked, You are in the right, will be cursed by peoples, abhorred by nations,
@704 but those who rebuke the wicked will have delight, and a good blessing will come upon them.
@705 Whoever gives an honest answer kisses the lips.
@706 Prepare your work outside; get everything ready for yourself in the field, and after that build your house.
@707 Be not a witness against your neighbor without cause, and do not deceive with your lips.
@708 Do not say, I will do to him as he has done to me; I will pay the man back for what he has done.
@709 I passed by the field of a sluggard, by the vineyard of a man lacking sense,
@710 and behold , it was all overgrown with thorns; the ground was covered with nettles, and its stone wall was broken down.
@711 Then I saw and considered it; I looked and received instruction.
@712 A little sleep , a little slumber, a little folding of the hands to rest,
@713 and poverty will come upon you like a robber, and want like an armed man.

# 25
@714 These also are proverbs of Solomon which the men of Hezekiah king of Judah copied.
@715 It is the glory of God to conceal things, but the glory of kings is to search things out.
@716 As the heavens for height , and the earth for depth, so the heart of kings is unsearchable.
@717 Take away the dross from the silver, and the smith has material for a vessel;
@718 take away the wicked from the presence of the king, and his throne will be established in righteousness.
@719 Do not put yourself forward in the king’s presence or stand in the place of the great,
@720 for it is better to be told, Come up here, than to be put lower in the presence of a noble. What your eyes have seen
@721 do not hastily bring into court, for what will you do in the end, when your neighbor puts you to shame?
@722 Argue your case with your neighbor himself, and do not reveal another’s secret,
@723 lest he who hears you bring shame upon you, and your ill repute have no end.
@724 A word fitly spoken is like apples of gold in a setting of silver.
@725 Like a gold ring or an ornament of gold is a wise reprover to a listening ear.
@726 Like the cold of snow in the time of harvest is a faithful messenger to those who send him; he refreshes the soul of his masters.
@727 Like clouds and wind without rain is a man who boasts of a gift he does not give.
@728 With patience a ruler may be persuaded, and a soft tongue will break a bone.
@729 If you have found honey, eat only enough for you, lest you have your fill of it and vomit it.
@730 Let your foot be seldom in your neighbor’s house, lest he have his fill of you and hate you.
@731 A man who bears false witness against his neighbor is like a war club , or a sword , or a sharp arrow.
@732 Trusting in a treacherous man in time of trouble is like a bad tooth or a foot that slips.
@733 Whoever sings songs to a heavy heart is like one who takes off a garment on a cold day, and like vinegar on soda.
@734 If your enemy is hungry , give him bread to eat, and if he is thirsty , give him water to drink,
@735 for you will heap burning coals on his head, and the Lord will reward you.
@736 The north wind brings forth rain, and a backbiting tongue, angry looks.
@737 It is better to live in a corner of the housetop than in a house shared with a quarrelsome wife.
@738 Like cold water to a thirsty soul, so is good news from a far country.
@739 Like a muddied spring or a polluted fountain is a righteous man who gives way before the wicked.
@740 It is not good to eat much honey, nor is it glorious to seek one’s own glory.
@741 A man without self-control is like a city broken into and left without walls.

# 26
@742 Like snow in summer or rain in harvest, so honor is not fitting for a fool.
@743 Like a sparrow in its flitting , like a swallow in its flying, a curse that is causeless does not alight.
@744 A whip for the horse , a bridle for the donkey, and a rod for the back of fools.
@745 Answer not a fool according to his folly, lest you be like him yourself.
@746 Answer a fool according to his folly, lest he be wise in his own eyes.
@747 Whoever sends a message by the hand of a fool cuts off his own feet and drinks violence.
@748 Like a lame man’s legs , which hang useless, is a proverb in the mouth of fools.
@749 Like one who binds the stone in the sling is one who gives honor to a fool.
@750 Like a thorn that goes up into the hand of a drunkard is a proverb in the mouth of fools.
@751 Like an archer who wounds everyone is one who hires a passing fool or drunkard.
@752 Like a dog that returns to his vomit is a fool who repeats his folly.
@753 Do you see a man who is wise in his own eyes? There is more hope for a fool than for him.
@754 The sluggard says, There is a lion in the road! There is a lion in the streets!
@755 As a door turns on its hinges, so does a sluggard on his bed.
@756 The sluggard buries his hand in the dish; it wears him out to bring it back to his mouth.
@757 The sluggard is wiser in his own eyes than seven men who can answer sensibly.
@758 Whoever meddles in a quarrel not his own is like one who takes a passing dog by the ears.
@759 Like a madman who throws firebrands, arrows , and death
@760 is the man who deceives his neighbor and says, I am only joking!
@761 For lack of wood the fire goes out, and where there is no whisperer, quarreling ceases.
@762 As charcoal to hot embers and wood to fire, so is a quarrelsome man for kindling strife.
@763 The words of a whisperer are like delicious morsels; they go down into the inner parts of the body.
@764 Like the glaze covering an earthen vessel are fervent lips with an evil heart.
@765 Whoever hates disguises himself with his lips and harbors deceit in his heart;
@766 when he speaks graciously, believe him not, for there are seven abominations in his heart;
@767 though his hatred be covered with deception, his wickedness will be exposed in the assembly.
@768 Whoever digs a pit will fall into it, and a stone will come back on him who starts it rolling.
@769 A lying tongue hates its victims, and a flattering mouth works ruin.

# 27
@770 Do not boast about tomorrow, for you do not know what a day may bring.
@771 Let another praise you, and not your own mouth; a stranger , and not your own lips.
@772 A stone is heavy , and sand is weighty, but a fool’s provocation is heavier than both.
@773 Wrath is cruel, anger is overwhelming, but who can stand before jealousy?
@774 Better is open rebuke than hidden love.
@775 Faithful are the wounds of a friend; profuse are the kisses of an enemy.
@776 One who is full loathes honey, but to one who is hungry everything bitter is sweet.
@777 Like a bird that strays from its nest is a man who strays from his home.
@778 Oil and perfume make the heart glad, and the sweetness of a friend comes from his earnest counsel.
@779 Do not forsake your friend and your father’s friend, and do not go to your brother’s house in the day of your calamity. Better is a neighbor who is near than a brother who is far away.
@780 Be wise, my son , and make my heart glad, that I may answer him who reproaches me.
@781 The prudent sees danger and hides himself, but the simple go on and suffer for it.
@782 Take a man’s garment when he has put up security for a stranger, and hold it in pledge when he puts up security for an adulteress.
@783 Whoever blesses his neighbor with a loud voice, rising early in the morning, will be counted as cursing.
@784 A continual dripping on a rainy day and a quarrelsome wife are alike;
@785 to restrain her is to restrain the wind or to grasp oil in one’s right hand.
@786 Iron sharpens iron, and one man sharpens another.
@787 Whoever tends a fig tree will eat its fruit, and he who guards his master will be honored.
@788 As in water face reflects face, so the heart of man reflects the man.
@789 Sheol and Abaddon are never satisfied, and never satisfied are the eyes of man.
@790 The crucible is for silver , and the furnace is for gold, and a man is tested by his praise.
@791 Crush a fool in a mortar with a pestle along with crushed grain, yet his folly will not depart from him.
@792 Know well the condition of your flocks, and give attention to your herds,
@793 for riches do not last forever; and does a crown endure to all generations?
@794 When the grass is gone and the new growth appears and the vegetation of the mountains is gathered,
@795 the lambs will provide your clothing, and the goats the price of a field.
@796 There will be enough goats ’ milk for your food, for the food of your household and maintenance for your girls.

@797 The wicked flee when no one pursues, but the righteous are bold as a lion.
@798 When a land transgresses, it has many rulers, but with a man of understanding and knowledge, its stability will long continue.
@799 A poor man who oppresses the poor is a beating rain that leaves no food.
@800 Those who forsake the law praise the wicked, but those who keep the law strive against them.
@801 Evil men do not understand justice, but those who seek the Lord understand it completely.
@802 Better is a poor man who walks in his integrity than a rich man who is crooked in his ways.
@803 The one who keeps the law is a son with understanding, but a companion of gluttons shames his father.
@804 Whoever multiplies his wealth by interest and profit gathers it for him who is generous to the poor.
@805 If one turns away his ear from hearing the law, even his prayer is an abomination.
@806 Whoever misleads the upright into an evil way will fall into his own pit, but the blameless will have a goodly inheritance.
@807 A rich man is wise in his own eyes, but a poor man who has understanding will find him out.
@808 When the righteous triumph , there is great glory, but when the wicked rise, people hide themselves.
@809 Whoever conceals his transgressions will not prosper, but he who confesses and forsakes them will obtain mercy.
@810 Blessed is the one who fears the Lord always, but hardens his heart will fall into calamity.
@811 Like a roaring lion or a charging bear is a wicked ruler over a poor people.
@812 A ruler who lacks understanding is a cruel oppressor, but he who hates unjust gain will prolong his days.
@813 If one is burdened with the blood of another, he will be a fugitive until death; let no one help him.
@814 Whoever walks in integrity will be delivered, but he who is crooked in his ways will suddenly fall.
@815 Whoever works his land will have plenty of bread, but he who follows worthless pursuits will have plenty of poverty.
@816 A faithful man will abound with blessings, but whoever hastens to be rich will not go unpunished.
@817 To partiality is not good, but for a piece of bread a man will do wrong.
@818 A stingy man hastens after wealth and does not know that poverty will come upon him.
@819 Whoever rebukes a man will afterward find more favor than he who flatters with his tongue.
@820 Whoever robs his father or his mother and says, That is no transgression, is a companion to a man who destroys.
@821 A greedy man stirs up strife, but the one who trusts in the Lord will be enriched.
@822 Whoever trusts in his own mind is a fool, but he who walks in wisdom will be delivered.
@823 Whoever gives to the poor will not want, but he who hides his eyes will get many a curse.
@824 When the wicked rise, people hide themselves, but when they perish , the righteous increase.

@826 When the righteous increase , the people rejoice, but when the wicked rule , the people groan.
@827 He who loves wisdom makes his father glad, but a companion of prostitutes squanders his wealth.
@828 By justice a king builds up the land, but he who exacts gifts tears it down.
@829 A man who flatters his neighbor spreads a net for his feet.
@830 An evil man is ensnared in his transgression, but a righteous sings and rejoices.
@831 A righteous man knows the rights of the poor; a wicked man does not understand such knowledge.
@832 Scoffers set a city aflame, but the wise turn away wrath.
@833 If a wise man has an argument with a fool, the fool only rages and laughs , and there is no quiet.
@834 Bloodthirsty men hate one who is blameless and seek the life of the upright.
@835 A fool gives full vent to his spirit, but a wise man quietly holds it back.
@836 If a ruler listens to falsehood, all his officials will be wicked.
@837 The poor man and the oppressor meet together; the Lord gives light to the eyes of both.
@838 If a king faithfully judges the poor, his throne will be established forever.
@839 The rod and reproof give wisdom, but a child left to himself brings shame to his mother.
@840 When the wicked increase, transgression increases, but the righteous will look upon their downfall.
@841 Discipline your son , and he will give you rest; he will give delight to your heart.
@842 Where there is no prophetic vision the people cast off restraint, but blessed is he who keeps the law.
@843 By mere words a servant is not disciplined, for though he understands , he will not respond.
@844 Do you see a man who is hasty in his words? There is more hope for a fool than for him.
@845 Whoever pampers his servant from childhood will in the end find him his heir.
@846 A man of wrath stirs up strife, and one given to anger causes much transgression.
@847 One’s pride will bring him low, but he who is lowly in spirit will obtain honor.
@848 The partner of a thief hates his own life; he hears the curse , but discloses nothing.

@851 An unjust man is an abomination to the righteous, but one whose way is straight is an abomination to the wicked.

@852 The words of Agur son of Jakeh . The oracle. The man declares , I am weary, O God; I am weary, O God , and worn out.
@853 Surely I am too stupid to be a man. I have not the understanding of a man.
@854 I have not learned wisdom, nor have I knowledge of the Holy One.
@855 Who has ascended to heaven and come down? Who has gathered the wind in his fists? Who has wrapped up the waters in a garment? Who has established all the ends of the earth? What is his name , and what is his son’s name? Surely you know!
@856 Every word of God proves true; he is a shield to those who take refuge in him.
@857 Do not add to his words, lest he rebuke you and you be found a liar.
@858 Two things I ask of you; deny them not to me before I die:
@859 Remove far from me falsehood and lying; give me neither poverty nor riches; feed me with the food that is needful for me,
@860 lest I be full and deny you and say, Who is the Lord? or lest I be poor and steal and profane the name of my God.
@861 Do not slander a servant to his master, lest he curse you, and you be held guilty.
@862 There are those who curse their fathers and do not bless their mothers.
@863 There are those who are clean in their own eyes but are not washed of their filth.
@864 There are those — how lofty are their eyes, how high their eyelids lift!
@865 There are those whose teeth are swords, whose fangs are knives, to devour the poor from off the earth, the needy from among mankind.
@866 The leech has two daughters: Give and Give. Three things are never satisfied; four never say, Enough:
@867 Sheol, the barren womb, the land never satisfied with water, and the fire that never says, Enough.
@868 The eye that mocks a father and scorns to obey a mother will be picked out by the ravens of the valley and eaten by the vultures.
@869 Three things are too wonderful for me; four I do not understand:
@870 the way of an eagle in the sky, the way of a serpent on a rock, the way of a ship on the high seas, and the way of a man with a virgin.
@871 This is the way of an adulteress: she eats and wipes her mouth and says, I have done no wrong.
@872 Under three things the earth trembles; under four it cannot bear up:
@873 a slave when he becomes king, and a fool when he is filled with food;
@874 an unloved woman when she gets a husband, and a maidservant when she displaces her mistress.
@875 Four things on earth are small, but they are exceedingly wise:
@876 the ants are a people not strong, yet they provide their food in the summer;
@877 the rock badgers are a people not mighty, yet they make their homes in the cliffs;
@878 the locusts have no king, yet all of them march in rank;
@879 the lizard you can take in your hands, yet it is in kings ’ palaces.
@880 Three things are stately in their tread; four are stately in their stride:
@881 the lion , which is mightiest among beasts and does not turn back before any;
@882 the strutting rooster, the he-goat, and a king whose army is with him.
@883 If you have been foolish, exalting yourself, or if you have been devising evil, put your hand on your mouth.
@884 For pressing milk produces curds, pressing the nose produces blood, and pressing anger produces strife.

@885 The words of King Lemuel . An oracle that his mother taught him:
@886 What are you doing , my son? What are you doing, son of my womb? What are you doing, son of my vows?
@887 Do not give your strength to women, your ways to those who destroy kings.
@888 It is not for kings , O Lemuel, it is not for kings to drink wine, or for rulers to take strong drink,
@889 lest they drink and forget what has been decreed and pervert the rights of all the afflicted.
@890 Give strong drink to the one who is perishing, and wine to those in bitter distress;
@891 let them drink and forget their poverty and remember their misery no more.
@892 Open your mouth for the mute, for the rights of all who are destitute.
@893 Open your mouth, judge righteously, defend the rights of the poor and needy.
@894 An excellent wife who can find? She is far more precious than jewels.
@895 The heart of her husband trusts in her, and he will have no lack of gain.
@896 She does him good , and not harm, all the days of her life.
@897 She seeks wool and flax, and works with willing hands.
@898 She is like the ships of the merchant; she brings her food from afar.
@899 She rises while it is yet night and provides food for her household and portions for her maidens.
@900 She considers a field and buys it; with the fruit of her hands she plants a vineyard.
@901 She dresses herself with strength and makes her arms strong.
@902 She perceives that her merchandise is profitable. Her lamp does not go out at night.
@903 She puts her hands to the distaff, and her hands hold the spindle.
@904 She opens her hand to the poor and reaches out her hands to the needy.
@905 She is not afraid of snow for her household, for all her household are clothed in scarlet.
@906 She makes bed coverings for herself; her clothing is fine linen and purple.
@907 Her husband is known in the gates when he sits among the elders of the land.
@908 She makes linen garments and sells them; she delivers sashes to the merchant.
@909 Strength and dignity are her clothing, and she laughs at the time to come.
@910 She opens her mouth with wisdom, and the teaching of kindness is on her tongue.
@911 She looks well to the ways of her household and does not eat the bread of idleness.
@912 Her children rise up and call her blessed; her husband also, and he praises her:
@913 Many women have done excellently, but you surpass them all.
@914 Charm is deceitful , and beauty is vain, but a woman who fears the Lord is to be praised.
@915 Give her of the fruit of her hands, and let her works praise her in the gates.
