@1 The Way of the Righteous and the Wicked Blessed is the man who walks not in the counsel of the wicked, nor stands in the way of sinners, nor sits in the seat of scoffers;
@2 but his delight is in the law of the Lord, and on his law he meditates day and night.
@3 He is like a tree planted by streams of water that yields its fruit in its season, and its leaf does not wither. In all that he does , he prospers.
@4 The wicked are not so, but are like chaff that the wind drives away.
@5 Therefore the wicked will not stand in the judgment, nor sinners in the congregation of the righteous;
@6 for the Lord knows the way of the righteous, but the way of the wicked will perish.

@7 The Reign of the Lord ’s Anointed Why do the nations rage and the peoples plot in vain?
@8 The kings of the earth set themselves, and the rulers take counsel together, against the Lord and against his Anointed , saying,
@9 Let us burst their bonds apart and cast away their cords from us.
@10 He who sits in the heavens laughs; the Lord holds them in derision.
@11 Then he will speak to them in his wrath, and terrify them in his fury , saying,
@12 As for me, I have set my King on Zion , my holy hill.
@13 I will tell of the decree: The Lord said to me, You are my Son; today I have begotten you.
@14 Ask of me, and I will make the nations your heritage, and the ends of the earth your possession.
@15 You shall break them with a rod of iron and dash them in pieces like a potter’s vessel.
@16 Now therefore, O kings , be wise; be warned , O rulers of the earth.
@17 Serve the Lord with fear, and rejoice with trembling.
@18 Kiss the Son, lest he be angry , and you perish in the way, for his wrath is quickly kindled. Blessed are all who take refuge in him.

@19 Save Me, O My God A Psalm of David, when he fled from Absalom his son. O Lord, how many are my foes! Many are rising against me;
@20 many are saying of my soul, there is no salvation for him in God. Selah
@21 But you, O Lord , are a shield about me, my glory , and the lifter of my head.
@22 I cried aloud to the Lord, and he answered me from his holy hill. Selah
@23 I lay down and slept; I woke again, for the Lord sustained me.
@24 I will not be afraid of many thousands of people who have set themselves against me all around.
@25 Arise , O Lord! Save me, O my God! For you strike all my enemies on the cheek; you break the teeth of the wicked.
@26 Salvation belongs to the Lord; your blessing be on your people! Selah

@27 Answer Me When I Call To the choirmaster : with stringed instruments . A Psalm of David. Answer me when I call , O God of my righteousness! You have given me relief when I was in distress. Be gracious to me and hear my prayer!
@28 O men, how long shall my honor be turned into shame? How long will you love vain words and seek after lies? Selah
@29 But know that the Lord has set apart the godly for himself; the Lord hears when I call to him.
@30 Be angry, and do not sin; ponder in your own hearts on your beds , and be silent. Selah
@31 Offer right sacrifices, and put your trust in the Lord.
@32 There are many who say, Who will show us some good? Lift up the light of your face upon us, O Lord!
@33 You have put more joy in my heart than they have when their grain and wine abound.
@34 In peace I will both lie down and sleep; for you alone , O Lord , make me dwell in safety.

@35 Lead Me in Your Righteousness To the choirmaster : for the flutes . A Psalm of David. Give ear to my words , O Lord; consider my groaning.
@36 Give attention to the sound of my cry, my King and my God, for to you do I pray.
@37 O Lord , in the morning you hear my voice; in the morning I prepare a sacrifice for you and watch.
@38 For you are not a God who delights in wickedness; evil may not dwell with you.
@39 The boastful shall not stand before your eyes; you hate all evildoers.
@40 You destroy those who speak lies; the Lord abhors the bloodthirsty and deceitful man.
@41 But I, through the abundance of your steadfast love, will enter your house. I will bow down toward your holy temple in the fear of you.
@42 Lead me, O Lord , in your righteousness because of my enemies; make your way straight before me.
@43 For there is no truth in their mouth; their inmost self is destruction; their throat is an open grave; they flatter with their tongue.
@44 Make them bear their guilt , O God; let them fall by their own counsels; because of the abundance of their transgressions cast them out, for they have rebelled against you.
@45 But let all who take refuge in you rejoice; let them ever sing for joy, and spread your protection over them, that those who love your name may exult in you.
@46 For you bless the righteous , O Lord; you cover him with favor as with a shield.

@47 O Lord , Deliver My Life To the choirmaster : with stringed instruments ; according to The Sheminith. A Psalm of David. O Lord, rebuke me not in your anger, nor discipline me in your wrath.
@48 Be gracious to me, O Lord , for I am languishing; heal me, O Lord, for my bones are troubled.
@49 My soul also is greatly troubled. But you, O Lord — how long?
@50 Turn , O Lord, deliver my life; save me for the sake of your steadfast love.
@51 For in death there is no remembrance of you; in Sheol who will give you praise?
@52 I am weary with my moaning; every night I flood my bed with tears; I drench my couch with my weeping.
@53 My eye wastes away because of grief; it grows weak because of all my foes.
@54 Depart from me, all you workers of evil, for the Lord has heard the sound of my weeping.
@55 The Lord has heard my plea; the Lord accepts my prayer.
@56 All my enemies shall be ashamed and greatly troubled; they shall turn back and be put to shame in a moment.

@57 In You Do I Take Refuge A Shiggaion of David , which he sang to the Lord concerning the words of Cush , a Benjaminite. O Lord my God , in you do I take refuge; save me from all my pursuers and deliver me,
@58 lest like a lion they tear my soul apart, rending it in pieces, with none to deliver.
@59 O Lord my God, if I have done this, if there is wrong in my hands,
@60 if I have repaid my friend with evil or plundered my enemy without cause,
@61 let the enemy pursue my soul and overtake it, and trample my life to the ground and lay my glory in the dust. Selah
@62 Arise , O Lord , in your anger; lift yourself up against the fury of my enemies; awake for me; you have appointed a judgment.
@63 Let the assembly of the peoples be gathered about you; over it return on high.
@64 The Lord judges the peoples; judge me, O Lord , according to my righteousness and according to the integrity that is in me.
@65 Oh, let the evil of the wicked come to an end, and may you establish the righteous — you who test the minds and hearts, O righteous God!
@66 My shield is with God, who saves the upright in heart.
@67 God is a righteous judge, and a God who indignation every day.
@68 If a man does not repent , God will whet his sword; he has bent and readied his bow;
@69 he has prepared for him his deadly weapons, making his arrows fiery shafts.
@70 Behold , the wicked man conceives evil and is pregnant with mischief and gives birth to lies.
@71 He makes a pit, digging it out, and falls into the hole that he has made.
@72 His mischief returns upon his own head, and on his own skull his violence descends.
@73 I will give to the Lord the thanks due to his righteousness, and I will sing praise to the name of the Lord , the Most High.

@74 How Majestic Is Your Name To the choirmaster : according to The Gittith. A Psalm of David. O Lord , our Lord, how majestic is your name in all the earth! You have set your glory above the heavens.
@75 Out of the mouth of babies and infants, you have established strength because of your foes, to still the enemy and the avenger.
@76 When I look at your heavens , the work of your fingers, the moon and the stars, which you have set in place,
@77 what is man that you are mindful of him, and the son of man that you care for him?
@78 Yet you have made him a little lower than the heavenly beings and crowned him with glory and honor.
@79 You have given him dominion over the works of your hands; you have put all things under his feet,
@80 all sheep and oxen, and also the beasts of the field,
@81 the birds of the heavens , and the fish of the sea, whatever passes along the paths of the seas.
@82 O Lord , our Lord, how majestic is your name in all the earth!

@83 I Will Recount Your Wonderful Deeds To the choirmaster : according to Muth-labben. A Psalm of David. I will give thanks to the Lord with my whole heart; I will recount all of your wonderful deeds.
@84 I will be glad and exult in you; I will sing praise to your name, O Most High.
@85 When my enemies turn back, they stumble and perish your presence.
@86 For you have maintained my just cause; you have sat on the throne, giving righteous judgment.
@87 You have rebuked the nations ; you have made the wicked perish; you have blotted out their name forever and ever.
@88 The enemy came to an end in everlasting ruins; their cities you rooted out; the very memory of them has perished.
@89 But the Lord sits enthroned forever; he has established his throne for justice,
@90 and he judges the world with righteousness; he judges the peoples with uprightness.
@91 The Lord is a stronghold for the oppressed, a stronghold in times of trouble.
@92 And those who know your name put their trust in you, for you, O Lord , have not forsaken those who seek you.
@93 Sing praises to the Lord , who sits enthroned in Zion! Tell among the peoples his deeds!
@94 For he who avenges blood is mindful of them; he does not forget the cry of the afflicted.
@95 Be gracious to me, O Lord! See my affliction from those who hate me, O you who lift me up from the gates of death,
@96 that I may recount all your praises, that in the gates of the daughter of Zion I may rejoice in your salvation.
@97 The nations have sunk in the pit that they made; in the net that they hid , their own foot has been caught.
@98 The Lord has made himself known ; he has executed judgment; the wicked are snared in the work of their own hands. Selah
@99 The wicked shall return to Sheol, all the nations that forget God.
@100 For the needy shall not always be forgotten, and the hope of the poor shall not perish forever.
@101 Arise , O Lord ! Let not man prevail; let the nations be judged before you!
@102 Put them in fear , O Lord! Let the nations know that they are but men! Selah

# 10
@103 Why Do You Hide Yourself? Why, O Lord , do you stand far away? Why do you hide yourself in times of trouble?
@104 In arrogance the wicked hotly pursue the poor; let them be caught in the schemes that they have devised.
@105 For the wicked boasts of the desires of his soul, and the one greedy for curses and renounces the Lord.
@106 In the pride of his face the wicked does not seek him; all his thoughts are, There is no God.
@107 His ways prosper at all times; your judgments are on high, out of his sight; as for all his foes , he puffs at them.
@108 He says in his heart, I shall not be moved; throughout all generations I shall not meet adversity.
@109 His mouth is filled with cursing and deceit and oppression; under his tongue are mischief and iniquity.
@110 He sits in ambush in the villages; in hiding places he murders the innocent. His eyes stealthily watch for the helpless;
@111 he lurks in ambush like a lion in his thicket; he lurks that he may seize the poor; he seizes the poor when he draws him into his net.
@112 The helpless are crushed, sink down, and fall by his might.
@113 He says in his heart, God has forgotten, he has hidden his face , he will never see it.
@114 Arise , O Lord ; O God, lift up your hand; forget not the afflicted.
@115 Why does the wicked renounce God and say in his heart, You will not call to account?
@116 But you do see , for you note mischief and vexation, that you may take it into your hands; to you the helpless commits himself; you have been the helper of the fatherless.
@117 Break the arm of the wicked and evildoer; call his wickedness to account till you find none.
@118 The Lord is king forever and ever; the nations perish from his land.
@119 O Lord , you hear the desire of the afflicted; you will strengthen their heart ; you will incline your ear
@120 to do justice to the fatherless and the oppressed, so that man who is of the earth may strike terror no more.

@121 The Lord Is in His Holy Temple To the choirmaster . Of David. In the Lord I take refuge; how can you say to my soul, Flee like a bird to your mountain,
@122 for behold , the wicked bend the bow; they have fitted their arrow to the string to shoot in the dark at the upright in heart;
@123 if the foundations are destroyed, what can the righteous do?
@124 The Lord is in his holy temple; the Lord ’s throne is in heaven; his eyes see , his eyelids test the children of man.
@125 The Lord tests the righteous, but his soul hates the wicked and the one who loves violence.
@126 Let him rain coals on the wicked; fire and sulfur and a scorching wind shall be the portion of their cup.
@127 For the Lord is righteous; he loves righteous deeds; the upright shall behold his face.

# 12
@128 The Faithful Have Vanished To the choirmaster : according to The Sheminith. A Psalm of David. Save , O Lord , for the godly one is gone; for the faithful have vanished from among the children of man.
@129 Everyone utters lies to his neighbor; with flattering lips and a double heart they speak.
@130 May the Lord cut off all flattering lips, the tongue that makes great boasts,
@131 those who say, With our tongue we will prevail, our lips are with us; who is master over us?
@132 Because the poor are plundered , because the needy groan, I will now arise, says the Lord; I will place him in the safety for which he longs.
@133 The words of the Lord are pure words, like silver refined in a furnace on the ground, purified seven times.
@134 You, O Lord , will keep them; you will guard us from this generation forever.
@135 On every side the wicked prowl, as vileness is exalted among the children of man.

# 13
@136 How Long, O Lord? To the choirmaster . A Psalm of David. How long , O Lord ? Will you forget me forever? How long will you hide your face from me?
@137 How long must I take counsel in my soul and have sorrow in my heart all the day? How long shall my enemy be exalted over me?
@138 Consider and answer me, O Lord my God; light up my eyes, lest I sleep the sleep of death,
@139 lest my enemy say, I have prevailed over him, lest my foes rejoice because I am shaken.
@140 But I have trusted in your steadfast love; my heart shall rejoice in your salvation.
@141 I will sing to the Lord, because he has dealt bountifully with me.

# 14
@142 The Fool Says, There Is No God To the choirmaster . Of David. The fool says in his heart, There is no God. They are corrupt , they do abominable deeds, there is none who does good.
@143 The Lord looks down from heaven on the children of man, to see if there are any who understand, who seek after God.
@144 They have all turned aside; together they have corrupt; there is none who does good, not even one.
@145 Have they no knowledge, all the evildoers who eat up my people as they eat bread and do not call upon the Lord?
@146 There they are in great terror, for God is with the generation of the righteous.
@147 You would shame the plans of the poor, but the Lord is his refuge.
@148 Oh, that salvation for Israel would come out of Zion! When the Lord restores the fortunes of his people, let Jacob rejoice , let Israel be glad.

# 15
@149 Who Shall Dwell on Your Holy Hill? A Psalm of David. O Lord, who shall sojourn in your tent? Who shall dwell on your holy hill?
@150 He who walks blamelessly and does what is right and speaks truth in his heart;
@151 who does not slander with his tongue and does no evil to his neighbor, nor takes up a reproach against his friend;
@152 in whose eyes a vile person is despised, but who honors those who fear the Lord; who swears to his own hurt and does not change;
@153 who does not put out his money at interest and does not take a bribe against the innocent. He who does these things shall never be moved.

# 16
@154 You Will Not Abandon My Soul A Miktam of David. Preserve me, O God, for in you I take refuge.
@155 I say to the Lord, You are my Lord; I have no good apart from you.
@156 As for the saints in the land, they are the excellent ones, in whom is all my delight.
@157 The sorrows of those who run after another god shall multiply; their drink offerings of blood I will not pour out or take their names on my lips.
@158 The Lord is my chosen portion and my cup; you hold my lot.
@159 The lines have fallen for me in pleasant places; indeed , I have a beautiful inheritance.
@160 I bless the Lord who gives me counsel; in the night also my heart instructs me.
@161 I have set the Lord always before me; because he is at my right hand , I shall not be shaken.
@162 Therefore my heart is glad , and my whole being rejoices; my flesh also dwells secure.
@163 For you will not abandon my soul to Sheol, or let your holy one see corruption.
@164 You make known to me the path of life; in your presence there is fullness of joy; at your right hand are pleasures forevermore.

# 17
@165 In the Shadow of Your Wings A Prayer of David. Hear a just cause, O Lord; attend to my cry! Give ear to my prayer from lips free of deceit!
@166 From your presence let my vindication come! Let your eyes behold the right!
@167 You have tried my heart , you have visited me by night, you have tested me, and you will find nothing; I have purposed that my mouth will not transgress.
@168 With regard to the works of man , by the word of your lips I have avoided the ways of the violent.
@169 My steps have held fast to your paths; my feet have not slipped.
@170 I call upon you, for you will answer me, O God; incline your ear to me; hear my words.
@171 Wondrously show your steadfast love, O Savior of those who seek refuge from their adversaries at your right hand.
@172 Keep me as the apple of your eye; hide me in the shadow of your wings,
@173 from the wicked who do me violence, my deadly enemies who surround me.
@174 They close their hearts to pity; with their mouths they speak arrogantly.
@175 They have now surrounded our steps; they set their eyes to cast us to the ground.
@176 He is like a lion eager to tear, as a young lion lurking in ambush.
@177 Arise , O Lord! Confront him, subdue him! Deliver my soul from the wicked by your sword,
@178 from men by your hand , O Lord, from men of the world whose portion is in this life. You fill their womb with treasure; they are satisfied with children, and they leave their abundance to their infants.
@179 As for me , I shall behold your face in righteousness; when I awake , I shall be satisfied with your likeness.

@180 The Lord Is My Rock and My Fortress To the choirmaster . A Psalm of David, the servant of the Lord, who addressed the words of this song to the Lord on the day when the Lord rescued him from the hand of all his enemies , and from the hand of Saul . He said: I love you, O Lord , my strength.
@181 The Lord is my rock and my fortress and my deliverer, my God , my rock , in whom I take refuge, my shield , and the horn of my salvation , my stronghold.
@182 I call upon the Lord , who is worthy to be praised, and I am saved from my enemies.
@183 The cords of death encompassed me; the torrents of destruction assailed me;
@184 the cords of Sheol entangled me; the snares of death confronted me.
@185 In my distress I called upon the Lord; to my God I cried for help. From his temple he heard my voice, and my cry to him reached his ears.
@186 Then the earth reeled and rocked; the foundations also of the mountains trembled and quaked, because he was angry.
@187 Smoke went up from his nostrils, and devouring fire from his mouth; glowing coals flamed forth from him.
@188 He bowed the heavens and came down; thick darkness was under his feet.
@189 He rode on a cherub and flew; he came swiftly on the wings of the wind.
@190 He made darkness his covering , his canopy around him, thick clouds dark with water.
@191 Out of the brightness before him hailstones and coals of fire broke through his clouds.
@192 The Lord also thundered in the heavens, and the Most High uttered his voice, hailstones and coals of fire.
@193 And he sent out his arrows and scattered them; he flashed forth lightnings and routed them.
@194 Then the channels of the sea were seen, and the foundations of the world were laid bare at your rebuke , O Lord, at the blast of the breath of your nostrils.
@195 He sent from on high , he took me; he drew me out of many waters.
@196 He rescued me from my strong enemy and from those who hated me, for too mighty for me.
@197 They confronted me in the day of my calamity, but the Lord was my support.
@198 He brought me out into a broad place; he rescued me, because he delighted in me.
@199 The Lord dealt with me according to my righteousness; according to the cleanness of my hands he rewarded me.
@200 For I have kept the ways of the Lord, and have not wickedly departed from my God.
@201 For all his rules were before me, and his statutes I did not put away from me.
@202 I was blameless before him, and I kept myself from my guilt.
@203 So the Lord has rewarded me according to my righteousness, according to the cleanness of my hands in his sight.
@204 With the merciful you show yourself merciful; with the blameless man you show yourself blameless;
@205 with the purified you show yourself pure; and with the crooked you make yourself seem tortuous.
@206 For you save a humble people, but the haughty eyes you bring down.
@207 For it is you who light my lamp; the Lord my God lightens my darkness.
@208 For by you I can run against a troop, and by my God I can leap over a wall.
@209 This God —his way is perfect; the word of the Lord proves true; he is a shield for all those who take refuge in him.
@210 For who is God, but the Lord? And who is a rock, except our God ?—
@211 the God who equipped me with strength and made my way blameless.
@212 He made my feet like the feet of a deer and set me secure on the heights.
@213 He trains my hands for war, so that my arms can bend a bow of bronze.
@214 You have given me the shield of your salvation, and your right hand supported me, and your gentleness made me great.
@215 You gave a wide place for my steps under me, and my feet did not slip.
@216 I pursued my enemies and overtook them, and did not turn back till they were consumed.
@217 I thrust them through , so that they were not able to rise; they fell under my feet.
@218 For you equipped me with strength for the battle; you made those who rise against me sink under me.
@219 You made my enemies turn their backs to me, and those who hated me I destroyed.
@220 They cried for help, but there was none to save; they cried to the Lord , but he did not answer them.
@221 I beat them fine as dust before the wind; I cast them out like the mire of the streets.
@222 You delivered me from strife with the people; you made me the head of the nations; people whom I had not known served me.
@223 As soon as they heard of me they obeyed me; foreigners came cringing to me.
@224 Foreigners lost heart and came trembling out of their fortresses.
@225 The Lord lives , and blessed be my rock, and exalted be the God of my salvation —
@226 the God who gave me vengeance and subdued peoples under me,
@227 who delivered me from my enemies; yes , you exalted me above those who rose against me; you rescued me from the man of violence.
@228 For this I will praise you, O Lord, among the nations, and sing to your name.
@229 Great salvation he brings to his king, and shows steadfast love to his anointed, to David and his offspring forever.

@230 The Law of the Lord Is Perfect To the choirmaster . A Psalm of David. The heavens declare the glory of God, and the sky above proclaims his handiwork.
@231 Day to day pours out speech, and night to night reveals knowledge.
@232 There is no speech, nor are there words, whose voice is not heard.
@233 Their voice goes out through all the earth, and their words to the end of the world. In them he has set a tent for the sun,
@234 which comes out like a bridegroom leaving his chamber, and, like a strong man, runs its course with joy.
@235 Its rising is from the end of the heavens, and its circuit to the end of them, and there is nothing hidden from its heat.
@236 The law of the Lord is perfect, reviving the soul; the testimony of the Lord is sure, making wise the simple;
@237 the precepts of the Lord are right, rejoicing the heart; the commandment of the Lord is pure, enlightening the eyes;
@238 the fear of the Lord is clean, enduring forever; the rules of the Lord are true, and righteous altogether.
@239 More to be desired are they than gold, even much fine gold; sweeter also than honey and drippings of the honeycomb.
@240 Moreover , by them is your servant warned; in keeping them there is great reward.
@241 Who can discern his errors? Declare me innocent from hidden faults.
@242 Keep back your servant also from presumptuous sins; let them not have dominion over me! Then I shall be blameless, and innocent of great transgression.
@243 Let the words of my mouth and the meditation of my heart be acceptable in your sight, O Lord , my rock and my redeemer.

@246 May he remember all your offerings and regard with favor your burnt sacrifices! Selah
@247 May he grant you your heart’s desire and fulfill all your plans!
@248 May we shout for joy over your salvation, and in the name of our God set up our banners! May the Lord fulfill all your petitions!
@249 Now I know that the Lord saves his anointed; he will answer him from his holy heaven with the saving might of his right hand.
@250 Some trust in chariots and some in horses, but we trust in the name of the Lord our God.

@254 You have given him his heart’s desire and have not withheld the request of his lips. Selah
@255 For you meet him with rich blessings; you set a crown of fine gold upon his head.
@256 He asked life of you; you gave it to him, length of days forever and ever.
@257 His glory is great through your salvation; splendor and majesty you bestow on him.
@258 For you make him most blessed forever; you make him glad with the joy of your presence.
@259 For the king trusts in the Lord, and through the steadfast love of the Most High he shall not be moved.
@260 Your hand will find out all your enemies; your right hand will find out those who hate you.
@261 You will make them as a blazing oven when you appear. The Lord will swallow them up in his wrath, and fire will consume them.
@262 You will destroy their descendants from the earth, and their offspring from among the children of man.
@263 Though they plan evil against you, devise mischief , they will not succeed.
@264 For you will put them to flight; you will aim at their faces with your bows.
@265 Be exalted , O Lord , in your strength! We will sing and praise your power.

@266 Why Have You Forsaken Me? To the choirmaster: according to The Doe of the Dawn . A Psalm of David. My God , my God, why have you forsaken me? Why are you so far from saving me, from the words of my groaning?
@267 O my God , I cry by day , but you do not answer, and by night , but I find no rest.
@268 Yet you are holy, enthroned on the praises of Israel.
@269 In you our fathers trusted; they trusted , and you delivered them.
@270 To you they cried and were rescued; in you they trusted and were not put to shame.
@271 But I am a worm and not a man, scorned by mankind and despised by the people.
@272 All who see me mock me; they make mouths at me; they wag their heads;
@273 He trusts in the Lord ; let him deliver him; let him rescue him, for he delights in him!
@274 Yet you are he who took me from the womb; you made me trust you at my mother’s breasts.
@275 On you was I cast from my birth, and from my mother’s womb you have been my God.
@276 Be not far from me, for trouble is near, and there is none to help.
@277 Many bulls encompass me; strong bulls of Bashan surround me;
@278 they open wide their mouths at me, like a ravening and roaring lion.
@279 I am poured out like water, and all my bones are out of joint; my heart is like wax; it is melted within my breast;
@280 my strength is dried up like a potsherd, and my tongue sticks to my jaws; you lay me in the dust of death.
@281 For dogs encompass me; a company of evildoers encircles me; they have pierced my hands and feet —
@282 I can count all my bones — they stare and gloat over me;
@283 they divide my garments among them, and for my clothing they cast lots.

@285 Deliver my soul from the sword, my precious life from the power of the dog!
@286 Save me from the mouth of the lion! You have rescued me from the horns of the wild oxen!
@287 I will tell of your name to my brothers; in the midst of the congregation I will praise you:
@288 You who fear the Lord, praise him! All you offspring of Jacob, glorify him, and stand in awe of him, all you offspring of Israel!
@289 For he has not despised or abhorred the affliction of the afflicted, and he has not hidden his face from him, but has heard , when he cried to him.
@290 From you comes my praise in the great congregation; my vows I will perform before those who fear him.
@291 The afflicted shall eat and be satisfied; those who seek him shall praise the Lord! May your hearts live forever!
@292 All the ends of the earth shall remember and turn to the Lord, and all the families of the nations shall worship before you.
@293 For kingship belongs to the Lord, and he rules over the nations.
@294 All the prosperous of the earth eat and worship; before him shall bow all who go down to the dust, even the one who could not keep himself alive.
@295 Posterity shall serve him; it shall be told of the Lord to the coming generation;
@296 they shall come and proclaim his righteousness to a people unborn, that he has done it.

@300 Even though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death, I will fear no evil, for you are with me; your rod and your staff, they comfort me.

@313 Teach Me Your Paths Of David. To you, O Lord , I lift up my soul.
@314 O my God , in you I trust; let me not be put to shame; let not my enemies exult over me.
@315 Indeed, none who wait for you shall be put to shame; they shall be ashamed who are wantonly treacherous.
@316 Make me to know your ways , O Lord; teach me your paths.
@317 Lead me in your truth and teach me, for you are the God of my salvation; for you I wait all the day long.
@318 Remember your mercy , O Lord , and your steadfast love, for they have been from of old.
@319 Remember not the sins of my youth or my transgressions; according to your steadfast love remember me, for the sake of your goodness , O Lord!
@320 Good and upright is the Lord; therefore he instructs sinners in the way.
@321 He leads the humble in what is right, and teaches the humble his way.
@322 All the paths of the Lord are steadfast love and faithfulness, for those who keep his covenant and his testimonies.
@323 For your name’s sake , O Lord, pardon my guilt, for it is great.
@324 Who is the man who fears the Lord? Him will he instruct in the way that he should choose.
@325 His soul shall abide in well-being, and his offspring shall inherit the land.
@326 The friendship of the Lord is for those who fear him, and he makes known to them his covenant.
@327 My eyes are ever toward the Lord, for he will pluck my feet out of the net.
@328 Turn to me and be gracious to me, for I am lonely and afflicted.
@329 The troubles of my heart are enlarged; bring me out of my distresses.
@330 Consider my affliction and my trouble, and forgive all my sins.
@331 Consider how many are my foes, and with what violent hatred they hate me.

@337 For your steadfast love is before my eyes, and I walk in your faithfulness.
@338 I do not sit with men of falsehood, nor do I consort with hypocrites.
@339 I hate the assembly of evildoers, and I will not sit with the wicked.
@340 I wash my hands in innocence and go around your altar , O Lord,
@341 proclaiming thanksgiving aloud, and telling all your wondrous deeds.
@342 O Lord , I love the habitation of your house and the place where your glory dwells.
@343 Do not sweep my soul away with sinners, nor my life with bloodthirsty men,
@344 in whose hands are evil devices, and whose right hands are full of bribes.
@345 But as for me , I shall walk in my integrity; redeem me, and be gracious to me.

@348 When evildoers assail me to eat up my flesh, my adversaries and foes, it is they who stumble and fall.
@349 Though an army encamp against me, my heart shall not fear; though war arise against me, yet I will be confident.
@350 One thing have I asked of the Lord, that will I seek after: that I may dwell in the house of the Lord all the days of my life, to gaze upon the beauty of the Lord and to inquire in his temple.
@351 For he will hide me in his shelter in the day of trouble; he will conceal me under the cover of his tent; he will lift me high upon a rock.
@352 And now my head shall be lifted up above my enemies all around me, and I will offer in his tent sacrifices with shouts of joy; I will sing and make melody to the Lord.
@353 Hear , O Lord , when I cry aloud; be gracious to me and answer me!
@354 You have said, Seek my face. My heart says to you, Your face, Lord , do I seek.
@355 Hide not your face from me. Turn not your servant away in anger, O you who have been my help. Cast me not off; forsake me not, O God of my salvation!
@356 For my father and my mother have forsaken me, but the Lord will take me in.
@357 Teach me your way , O Lord, and lead me on a level path because of my enemies.
@358 Give me not up to the will of my adversaries; for false witnesses have risen against me, and they breathe out violence.

@364 Give to them according to their work and according to the evil of their deeds; give to them according to the work of their hands; render them their due reward.
@365 Because they do not regard the works of the Lord or the work of his hands, he will tear them down and build them up no more.
@366 Blessed be the Lord! For he has heard the voice of my pleas for mercy.
@367 The Lord is my strength and my shield; in him my heart trusts , and I am helped; my heart exults, and with my song I give thanks to him.

@381 Joy Comes with the Morning A Psalm of David . A song at the dedication of the temple. I will extol you, O Lord , for you have drawn me up and have not let my foes rejoice over me.
@382 O Lord my God , I cried to you for help, and you have healed me.
@383 O Lord , you have brought up my soul from Sheol; you restored me to life from among those who go down to the pit.
@384 Sing praises to the Lord , O you his saints, and give thanks to his holy name.
@385 For his anger is but for a moment, and his favor is for a lifetime. Weeping may tarry for the night, but joy comes with the morning.
@386 As for me, I said in my prosperity, I shall never be moved.
@387 By your favor , O Lord, you made my mountain stand strong; you hid your face; I was dismayed.
@388 To you, O Lord , I cry, and to the Lord Lord I plead for mercy:
@389 What profit is there in my death, if I go down to the pit? Will the dust praise you? Will it tell of your faithfulness?
@390 Hear , O Lord , and be merciful to me! O Lord , be my helper!
@391 You have turned for me my mourning into dancing; you have loosed my sackcloth and clothed me with gladness,
@392 that my glory may sing your praise and not be silent. O Lord my God , I will give thanks to you forever!

@393 Into Your Hand I Commit My Spirit To the choirmaster . A Psalm of David. In you, O Lord , do I take refuge; let me never be put to shame; in your righteousness deliver me!
@394 Incline your ear to me; rescue me speedily! Be a rock of refuge for me, a strong fortress to save me!
@395 For you are my rock and my fortress; and for your name’s sake you lead me and guide me;
@396 you take me out of the net they have hidden for me, for you are my refuge.
@397 Into your hand I commit my spirit; you have redeemed me, O Lord, faithful God.
@398 I hate those who pay regard to worthless idols, but I trust in the Lord.
@399 I will rejoice and be glad in your steadfast love, because you have seen my affliction; you have known the distress of my soul,
@400 and you have not delivered me into the hand of the enemy; you have set my feet in a broad place.
@401 Be gracious to me, O Lord , for I am in distress; my eye is wasted from grief; my soul and my body also.
@402 For my life is spent with sorrow, and my years with sighing; my strength fails because of my iniquity, and my bones waste away.
@403 Because of all my adversaries I have become a reproach, especially to my neighbors, and an object of dread to my acquaintances; those who see me in the street flee from me.
@404 I have been forgotten like one who is dead; I have become like a broken vessel.
@405 For I hear the whispering of many — terror on every side !— as they scheme together against me, as they plot to take my life.
@406 But I trust in you, O Lord; I say, You are my God.
@407 My times are in your hand; rescue me from the hand of my enemies and from my persecutors!
@408 Make your face shine on your servant; save me in your steadfast love!
@409 O Lord, let me not be put to shame, for I call upon you; let the wicked be put to shame; let them silently to Sheol.
@410 Let the lying lips be mute, which speak insolently against the righteous in pride and contempt.
@411 Oh, how abundant is your goodness, which you have stored up for those who fear you and worked for those who take refuge in you, in the sight of the children of mankind!
@412 In the cover of your presence you hide them from the plots of men; you store them in your shelter from the strife of tongues.
@413 Blessed be the Lord, for he has wondrously shown his steadfast love to me when I was in a besieged city.
@414 I had said in my alarm, I am cut off from your sight. But you heard the voice of my pleas for mercy when I cried to you for help.
@415 Love the Lord, all you his saints! The Lord preserves the faithful but abundantly repays the one who acts in pride.
@416 Be strong , and let your heart take courage, all you who wait for the Lord!

@417 Blessed Are the Forgiven A Maskil of David. Blessed is the one whose transgression is forgiven, whose sin is covered.
@418 Blessed is the man against whom the Lord counts no iniquity, and in whose spirit there is no deceit.
@419 For when I kept silent , my bones wasted away through my groaning all day long.
@420 For day and night your hand was heavy upon me; my strength was dried up as by the heat of summer. Selah
@421 I acknowledged my sin to you, and I did not cover my iniquity; I said, I will confess my transgressions to the Lord, and you forgave the iniquity of my sin. Selah
@422 Therefore let everyone who is godly offer prayer to you at a time when you may be found; surely in the rush of great waters, they shall not reach him.
@423 You are a hiding place for me; you preserve me from trouble; you surround me with shouts of deliverance. Selah
@424 I will instruct you and teach you in the way you should go; I will counsel you with my eye upon you.
@425 Be not like a horse or a mule, without understanding, which must be curbed with bit and bridle, or it will not stay near you.

@431 For the word of the Lord is upright, and all his work is done in faithfulness.
@432 He loves righteousness and justice; the earth is full of the steadfast love of the Lord.
@433 By the word of the Lord the heavens were made, and by the breath of his mouth all their host.
@434 He gathers the waters of the sea as a heap; he puts the deeps in storehouses.
@435 Let all the earth fear the Lord; let all the inhabitants of the world stand in awe of him!
@436 For he spoke , and it came to be; he commanded , and it stood firm.
@437 The Lord brings the counsel of the nations to nothing; he frustrates the plans of the peoples.
@438 The counsel of the Lord stands forever, the plans of his heart to all generations.
@439 Blessed is the nation whose God is the Lord, the people whom he has chosen as his heritage!
@440 The Lord looks down from heaven; he sees all the children of man;
@441 from where he sits enthroned he looks out on all the inhabitants of the earth,
@442 he who fashions the hearts of them all and observes all their deeds.
@443 The king is not saved by his great army; a warrior is not delivered by his great strength.
@444 The war horse is a false hope for salvation, and by its great might it cannot rescue.
@445 Behold, the eye of the Lord is on those who fear him, on those who hope in his steadfast love,
@446 that he may deliver their soul from death and keep them alive in famine.
@447 Our soul waits for the Lord; he is our help and our shield.
@448 For our heart is glad in him, because we trust in his holy name.
@449 Let your steadfast love , O Lord , be upon us, even as we hope in you.

@450 Taste and See That the Lord Is Good Of David , when he changed his behavior before Abimelech , so that he drove him out , and he went away. I will bless the Lord at all times; his praise shall continually be in my mouth.
@451 My soul makes its boast in the Lord; let the humble hear and be glad.
@452 Oh, magnify the Lord with me, and let us exalt his name together!
@453 I sought the Lord , and he answered me and delivered me from all my fears.
@454 Those who look to him are radiant, and their faces shall never be ashamed.
@455 This poor man cried , and the Lord heard him and saved him out of all his troubles.
@456 The angel of the Lord encamps around those who fear him, and delivers them.
@457 Oh, taste and see that the Lord is good! Blessed is the man who takes refuge in him!
@458 Oh, fear the Lord , you his saints, for those who fear him have no lack!
@459 The young lions suffer want and hunger; but those who seek the Lord lack no good thing.
@460 Come , O children, listen to me; I will teach you the fear of the Lord.
@461 What man is there who desires life and loves many days , that he may see good?
@462 Keep your tongue from evil and your lips from speaking deceit.
@463 Turn away from evil and do good; seek peace and pursue it.
@464 The eyes of the Lord are toward the righteous and his ears toward their cry.
@465 The face of the Lord is against those who do evil, to cut off the memory of them from the earth.
@466 When the righteous cry for help , the Lord hears and delivers them out of all their troubles.
@467 The Lord is near to the brokenhearted and saves the crushed in spirit.
@468 Many are the afflictions of the righteous, but the Lord delivers him out of them all.
@469 He keeps all his bones; not one of them is broken.
@470 Affliction will slay the wicked, and those who hate the righteous will be condemned.
@471 The Lord redeems the life of his servants; none of those who take refuge in him will be condemned.

@472 Great Is the Lord Of David. Contend , O Lord , with those who contend with me; fight against those who fight against me!
@473 Take hold of shield and buckler and rise for my help!
@474 Draw the spear and javelin against my pursuers! Say to my soul, I am your salvation!
@475 Let them be put to shame and dishonor who seek after my life! Let them be turned back and disappointed who devise evil against me!
@476 Let them be like chaff before the wind, with the angel of the Lord driving them away!
@477 Let their way be dark and slippery, with the angel of the Lord pursuing them!
@478 For without cause they hid their net for me; without cause they dug a pit for my life.
@479 Let destruction come upon him when he does not know it! And let the net that he hid ensnare him; let him fall into it—to his destruction!
@480 Then my soul will rejoice in the Lord, exulting in his salvation.
@481 All my bones shall say, O Lord, who is like you, delivering the poor from him who is too strong for him, the poor and needy from him who robs him?
@482 Malicious witnesses rise up; they ask me of things that I do not know.
@483 They repay me evil for good; my soul is bereft.
@484 But I, when they were sick — I wore sackcloth; I afflicted myself with fasting; I prayed with head bowed on my chest.
@485 I went about as though I grieved for my friend or my brother; as one who laments his mother, I bowed down in mourning.
@486 But at my stumbling they rejoiced and gathered; they gathered together against me; wretches whom I did not know tore at me without ceasing;
@487 like profane mockers at a feast, they gnash at me with their teeth.
@488 How long , O Lord , will you look on? Rescue me from their destruction, my precious life from the lions!
@489 I will thank you in the great congregation; in the mighty throng I will praise you.
@490 Let not those rejoice over me who are wrongfully my foes, and let not those wink the eye who hate me without cause.
@491 For they do not speak peace, but against those who are quiet in the land they devise words of deceit.
@492 They open wide their mouths against me; they say, Aha, Aha! Our eyes have seen it!
@493 You have seen , O Lord; be not silent! O Lord, be not far from me!
@494 Awake and rouse yourself for my vindication, for my cause , my God and my Lord!
@495 Vindicate me, O Lord , my God, according to your righteousness, and let them not rejoice over me!
@496 Let them not say in their hearts, Aha , our heart’s desire! Let them not say, We have swallowed him up.
@497 Let them be put to shame and disappointed altogether who rejoice at my calamity! Let them be clothed with shame and dishonor who magnify themselves against me!
@498 Let those who delight in my righteousness shout for joy and be glad and say evermore, Great is the Lord, who delights in the welfare of his servant!
@499 Then my tongue shall tell of your righteousness and of your praise all the day long.

@500 How Precious Is Your Steadfast Love To the choirmaster . Of David , the servant of the Lord. Transgression speaks to the wicked deep in his heart; there is no fear of God before his eyes.
@501 For he flatters himself in his own eyes that his iniquity cannot be found out and hated.
@502 The words of his mouth are trouble and deceit; he has ceased to act wisely and do good.
@503 He plots trouble while on his bed; he sets himself in a way that is not good; he does not reject evil.
@504 Your steadfast love , O Lord , extends to the heavens, your faithfulness to the clouds.
@505 Your righteousness is like the mountains of God; your judgments are like the great deep; man and beast you save , O Lord.
@506 How precious is your steadfast love , O God! The children of mankind in the shadow of your wings.
@507 They feast on the abundance of your house, and you give them drink from the river of your delights.
@508 For with you is the fountain of life; in your light do we see light.
@509 Oh, continue your steadfast love to those who know you, and your righteousness to the upright of heart!
@510 Let not the foot of arrogance come upon me, nor the hand of the wicked drive me away.
@511 There the evildoers lie fallen; they are thrust down, unable to rise.

# 37
@512 He Will Not Forsake His Saints Of David. Fret not yourself because of evildoers; be not envious of wrongdoers!
@513 For they will soon fade like the grass and wither like the green herb.
@514 Trust in the Lord , and do good; dwell in the land and befriend faithfulness.
@515 Delight yourself in the Lord, and he will give you the desires of your heart.
@516 Commit your way to the Lord; trust in him, and he will act.
@517 He will bring forth your righteousness as the light, and your justice as the noonday.
@518 Be still before the Lord and wait patiently for him; fret not yourself over the one who prospers in his way, over the man who carries out evil devices!
@519 Refrain from anger , and forsake wrath! Fret not yourself; it tends only to evil.
@520 For the evildoers shall be cut off, but those who wait for the Lord shall inherit the land.
@521 In just a little while , the wicked will be no more; though you look carefully at his place , he will not be there.
@522 But the meek shall inherit the land and delight themselves in abundant peace.
@523 The wicked plots against the righteous and gnashes his teeth at him,
@524 but the Lord laughs at the wicked, for he sees that his day is coming.
@525 The wicked draw the sword and bend their bows to bring down the poor and needy, to slay those whose way is upright;
@526 their sword shall enter their own heart, and their bows shall be broken.
@527 Better is the little that the righteous has than the abundance of many wicked.
@528 For the arms of the wicked shall be broken, but the Lord upholds the righteous.
@529 The Lord knows the days of the blameless, and their heritage will remain forever;
@530 they are not put to shame in evil times; in the days of famine they have abundance.
@531 But the wicked will perish; the enemies of the Lord are like the glory of the pastures; they vanish —like smoke they vanish away.
@532 The wicked borrows but does not pay back, but the righteous is generous and gives;
@533 for those blessed by the Lord shall inherit the land, but those cursed by him shall be cut off.
@534 The steps of a man are established by the Lord, when he delights in his way;
@535 though he fall , he shall not be cast headlong, for the Lord upholds his hand.
@536 I have been young , and now am old, yet I have not seen the righteous forsaken or his children begging for bread.
@537 He is ever lending generously, and his children become a blessing.
@538 Turn away from evil and do good; so shall you dwell forever.
@539 For the Lord loves justice; he will not forsake his saints. They are preserved forever, but the children of the wicked shall be cut off.
@540 The righteous shall inherit the land and dwell upon it forever.
@541 The mouth of the righteous utters wisdom, and his tongue speaks justice.
@542 The law of his God is in his heart; his steps do not slip.
@543 The wicked watches for the righteous and seeks to put him to death.
@544 The Lord will not abandon him to his power or be condemned when he is brought to trial.
@545 Wait for the Lord and keep his way, and he will exalt you to inherit the land; you will look on when the wicked are cut off.
@546 I have seen a wicked, ruthless man, spreading himself like a green laurel tree.
@547 But he passed away, and behold, he was no more; though I sought him, he could not be found.
@548 Mark the blameless and behold the upright, for there is a future for the man of peace.
@549 But transgressors shall be altogether destroyed; the future of the wicked shall be cut off.
@550 The salvation of the righteous is from the Lord; he is their stronghold in the time of trouble.
@551 The Lord helps them and delivers them; he delivers them from the wicked and saves them, because they take refuge in him.

@552 Do Not Forsake Me, O Lord A Psalm of David, for the memorial offering. O Lord, rebuke me not in your anger, nor discipline me in your wrath!
@553 For your arrows have sunk into me, and your hand has come down on me.
@554 There is no soundness in my flesh because of your indignation; there is no health in my bones because of my sin.
@555 For my iniquities have gone over my head; like a heavy burden , they are too heavy for me.
@556 My wounds stink and fester because of my foolishness,
@557 I am utterly bowed prostrate; all the day I go about mourning.
@558 For my sides are filled with burning, and there is no soundness in my flesh.
@559 I am feeble and crushed; I groan because of the tumult of my heart.
@560 O Lord, all my longing is before you; my sighing is not hidden from you.
@561 My heart throbs ; my strength fails me, and the light of my eyes — it also has gone from me.
@562 My friends and companions stand aloof from my plague, and my nearest kin stand far off.
@563 Those who seek my life lay their snares; those who seek my hurt speak of ruin and meditate treachery all day long.
@564 But I am like a deaf man; I do not hear, like a mute man who does not open his mouth.
@565 I have become like a man who does not hear, and in whose mouth are no rebukes.
@566 But for you, O Lord , do I wait; it is you, O Lord my God , who will answer.
@567 For I said, Only let them not rejoice over me, who boast against me when my foot slips!
@568 For I am ready to fall, and my pain is ever before me.
@569 I confess my iniquity; I am sorry for my sin.
@570 But my foes are vigorous , they are mighty, and many are those who hate me wrongfully.
@571 Those who render me evil for good accuse me because I follow after good.

@574 What Is the Measure of My Days? To the choirmaster : to Jeduthun . A Psalm of David. I said, I will guard my ways, that I may not sin with my tongue; I will guard my mouth with a muzzle, so long as the wicked are in my presence.
@575 I was mute and silent; I held my peace to no avail, and my distress grew worse.
@576 My heart became hot within me. As I mused , the fire burned; then I spoke with my tongue:
@577 O Lord, make me know my end and what is the measure of my days; let me know how fleeting I am!
@578 Behold , you have made my days a few handbreadths, and my lifetime is as nothing before you. Surely all mankind stands as a mere breath! Selah
@579 Surely a man goes about as a shadow! Surely for nothing they are in turmoil; man heaps up wealth and does not know who will gather!
@580 And now , O Lord , for what do I wait? My hope is in you.
@581 Deliver me from all my transgressions. Do not make me the scorn of the fool!
@582 I am mute ; I do not open my mouth, for it is you who have done it.
@583 Remove your stroke from me; I am spent by the hostility of your hand.
@584 When you discipline a man with rebukes for sin, you consume like a moth what is dear to him; surely all mankind is a mere breath! Selah
@585 Hear my prayer , O Lord, and give ear to my cry; hold not your peace at my tears! For I am a sojourner with you, a guest , like all my fathers.
@586 Look away from me, that I may smile again, before I depart and am no more!

@587 My Help and My Deliverer To the choirmaster . A Psalm of David. I waited patiently for the Lord; he inclined to me and heard my cry.
@588 He drew me up from the pit of destruction, out of the miry bog, and set my feet upon a rock, making my steps secure.
@589 He put a new song in my mouth, a song of praise to our God. Many will see and fear, and put their trust in the Lord.
@590 Blessed is the man who makes the Lord his trust, who does not turn to the proud, to those who go astray after a lie!
@591 You have multiplied , O Lord my God, your wondrous deeds and your thoughts toward us; none can compare with you! I will proclaim and tell of them, yet they are more than can be told.
@592 In sacrifice and offering you have not delighted, but you have given me an open ear. Burnt offering and sin offering you have not required.
@593 Then I said, Behold , I have come; in the scroll of the book it is written of me:
@594 I delight to do your will , O my God; your law is within my heart.
@595 I have told the glad news of deliverance in the great congregation; behold , I have not restrained my lips, as you know , O Lord.
@596 I have not hidden your deliverance within my heart; I have spoken of your faithfulness and your salvation; I have not concealed your steadfast love and your faithfulness from the great congregation.
@597 As for you, O Lord , you will not restrain your mercy from me; your steadfast love and your faithfulness will ever preserve me!
@598 For evils have encompassed me beyond number; my iniquities have overtaken me, and I cannot see; they are more than the hairs of my head; my heart fails me.
@599 Be pleased , O Lord , to deliver me! O Lord, make haste to help me!
@600 Let those be put to shame and disappointed altogether who seek to snatch away my life; let those be turned back and brought to dishonor who delight in my hurt!
@601 Let those be appalled because of their shame who say to me, Aha, Aha!
@602 But may all who seek you rejoice and be glad in you; may those who love your salvation say continually, Great is the Lord!
@603 As for me, I am poor and needy, but the Lord takes thought for me. You are my help and my deliverer; do not delay , O my God!

# 41
@604 O Lord , Be Gracious to Me To the choirmaster . A Psalm of David. Blessed is the one who considers the poor! In the day of trouble the Lord delivers him;
@605 the Lord protects him and keeps him alive; he is called blessed in the land; you do not give him up to the will of his enemies.
@606 The Lord sustains him on his sickbed; in his illness you restore him to full health.
@607 As for me, I said, O Lord, be gracious to me; heal me, for I have sinned against you!
@608 My enemies say of me in malice, When will he die , and his name perish?
@609 And when one comes to see me, he utters empty words, while his heart gathers iniquity; when he goes out, he tells it abroad.
@610 All who hate me whisper together about me; they imagine the worst for me.
@611 They say, A deadly thing is poured out on him; he will not rise again from where he lies.
@612 Even my close friend in whom I trusted, who ate my bread , has lifted his heel against me.
@613 But you, O Lord , be gracious to me, and raise me up, that I may repay them!
@614 By this I know that you delight in me: my enemy will not shout in triumph over me.
@615 But you have upheld me because of my integrity, and set me in your presence forever.
@616 Blessed be the Lord , the God of Israel, from everlasting to everlasting! Amen and Amen. Book Two

@617 Why Are You Cast Down, O My Soul? To the choirmaster . A Maskil of the Sons of Korah. As a deer pants for flowing streams, so pants my soul for you, O God.
@618 My soul thirsts for God, for the living God. When shall I come and appear before God?
@619 My tears have been my food day and night, while they say to me all the day long, Where is your God?
@620 These things I remember, as I pour out my soul: how I would go with the throng and lead them in procession to the house of God with glad shouts and songs of praise, a multitude keeping festival.
@621 Why are you cast down, O my soul, and why are you in turmoil within me? Hope in God ; for I shall again praise him, my salvation
@622 and my God. My soul is cast down within me; therefore I remember you from the land of Jordan and of Hermon, from Mount Mizar.
@623 Deep calls to deep at the roar of your waterfalls; all your breakers and your waves have gone over me.
@624 By day the Lord commands his steadfast love, and at night his song is with me, a prayer to the God of my life.
@625 I say to God, my rock: Why have you forgotten me? Why do I go mourning because of the oppression of the enemy?
@626 As with a deadly wound in my bones, my adversaries taunt me, while they say to me all the day long, Where is your God?
@627 Why are you cast down, O my soul, and why are you in turmoil within me? Hope in God ; for I shall again praise him, my salvation and my God.

# 43
@628 Send Out Your Light and Your Truth Vindicate me, O God , and defend my cause against an ungodly people, from the deceitful and unjust man deliver me!
@629 For you are the God in whom I take refuge; why have you rejected me? Why do I go about mourning because of the oppression of the enemy?
@630 Send out your light and your truth; let them lead me; let them bring me to your holy hill and to your dwelling!
@631 Then I will go to the altar of God, to God my exceeding joy, and I will praise you with the lyre, O God , my God.
@632 Why are you cast down , O my soul, and why are you in turmoil within me? Hope in God; for I shall again praise him, my salvation and my God.

# 44
@633 Come to Our Help To the choirmaster. A Maskil of the Sons of Korah. O God , we have heard with our ears, our fathers have told us, what deeds you performed in their days, in the days of old:
@634 you with your own hand drove out the nations, but them you planted; you afflicted the peoples, but them you set free;
@635 for not by their own sword did they win the land, nor did their own arm save them, but your right hand and your arm, and the light of your face, for you delighted in them.
@636 You are my King , O God; ordain salvation for Jacob!
@637 Through you we push down our foes; through your name we tread down those who rise up against us.
@638 For not in my bow do I trust, nor can my sword save me.
@639 But you have saved us from our foes and have put to shame those who hate us.
@640 In God we have boasted continually, and we will give thanks to your name forever. Selah
@641 But you have rejected us and disgraced us and have not gone out with our armies.
@642 You have made us turn back from the foe, and those who hate us have gotten spoil.
@643 You have made us like sheep for slaughter and have scattered us among the nations.
@644 You have sold your people for a trifle, demanding no high price for them.
@645 You have made us the taunt of our neighbors, the derision and scorn of those around us.
@646 You have made us a byword among the nations, a laughingstock among the peoples.
@647 All day long my disgrace is before me, and shame has covered my face
@648 at the sound of the taunter and reviler, at the sight of the enemy and the avenger.
@649 All this has come upon us, though we have not forgotten you, and we have not been false to your covenant.
@650 Our heart has not turned back, nor have our steps departed from your way;
@651 yet you have broken us in the place of jackals and covered us with the shadow of death.
@652 If we had forgotten the name of our God or spread out our hands to a foreign god,
@653 would not God discover this? For he knows the secrets of the heart.
@654 Yet for your sake we are killed all the day long; we are regarded as sheep to be slaughtered.
@655 Awake! Why are you sleeping , O Lord? Rouse yourself! Do not reject us forever!
@656 Why do you hide your face? Why do you forget our affliction and oppression?
@657 For our soul is bowed down to the dust; our belly clings to the ground.
@658 Rise up; come to our help! Redeem us for the sake of your steadfast love!

@659 Your Throne, O God, Is Forever To the choirmaster : according to Lilies . A Maskil of the Sons of Korah ; a love song. My heart overflows with a pleasing theme; I address my verses to the king; my tongue is like the pen of a ready scribe.
@660 You are the most handsome of the sons of men; grace is poured upon your lips; therefore God has blessed you forever.
@661 Gird your sword on your thigh , O mighty one, in your splendor and majesty!
@662 In your majesty ride out victoriously for the cause of truth and meekness and righteousness; let your right hand teach you awesome deeds!
@663 Your arrows are sharp in the heart of the king’s enemies; the peoples fall under you.
@664 Your throne , O God , is forever and ever. The scepter of your kingdom is a scepter of uprightness;
@665 you have loved righteousness and hated wickedness. Therefore God , your God , has anointed you with the oil of gladness beyond your companions;
@666 your robes are all fragrant with myrrh and aloes and cassia. From ivory palaces stringed instruments make you glad;
@667 daughters of kings are among your ladies of honor; at your right hand stands the queen in gold of Ophir.
@668 Hear , O daughter , and consider , and incline your ear: forget your people and your father’s house,
@669 and the king will desire your beauty. Since he is your lord, bow to him.
@670 The people of Tyre will seek your favor with gifts, the richest of the people.
@671 All glorious is the princess in her chamber , with robes interwoven with gold.
@672 In many-colored robes she is led to the king, with her virgin companions following behind her.
@673 With joy and gladness they are led along as they enter the palace of the king.
@674 In place of your fathers shall be your sons; you will make them princes in all the earth.
@675 I will cause your name to be remembered in all generations; therefore nations will praise you forever and ever.

@676 God Is Our Fortress To the choirmaster . Of the Sons of Korah. According to Alamoth. A Song. God is our refuge and strength, a very present help in trouble.
@677 Therefore we will not fear though the earth gives way, though the mountains be moved into the heart of the sea,
@678 though its waters roar and foam, though the mountains tremble at its swelling. Selah
@679 There is a river whose streams make glad the city of God, the holy habitation of the Most High.
@680 God is in the midst of her; she shall not be moved; God will help her when morning dawns.
@681 The nations rage , the kingdoms totter; he utters his voice , the earth melts.
@682 The Lord of hosts is with us; the God of Jacob is our fortress. Selah
@683 Come, behold the works of the Lord, how he has brought desolations on the earth.
@684 He makes wars cease to the end of the earth; he breaks the bow and shatters the spear; he burns the chariots with fire.
@685 Be still , and know that I am God. I will be exalted among the nations, I will be exalted in the earth!
@686 The Lord of hosts is with us; the God of Jacob is our fortress. Selah

# 47
@687 God Is King over All the Earth To the choirmaster . A Psalm of the Sons of Korah. Clap your hands, all peoples! Shout to God with loud songs of joy!
@688 For the Lord , the Most High, is to be feared, a great king over all the earth.
@689 He subdued peoples under us, and nations under our feet.
@690 He chose our heritage for us, the pride of Jacob whom he loves. Selah
@691 God has gone up with a shout, the Lord with the sound of a trumpet.
@692 Sing praises to God, sing praises! Sing praises to our King, sing praises!
@693 For God is the King of all the earth; sing praises with a psalm!
@694 God reigns over the nations; God sits on his holy throne.
@695 The princes of the peoples gather as the people of the God of Abraham. For the shields of the earth belong to God; he is highly exalted!

# 48
@696 Zion, the City of Our God A Song . A Psalm of the Sons of Korah. Great is the Lord and greatly to be praised in the city of our God! His holy mountain,
@697 beautiful in elevation, is the joy of all the earth, Mount Zion , in the far north, the city of the great King.
@698 Within her citadels God has made himself known as a fortress.
@699 For behold, the kings assembled; they came on together.
@700 As soon as they saw it, they were astounded; they were in panic ; they took to flight.
@701 Trembling took hold of them there, anguish as of a woman in labor.
@702 By the east wind you shattered the ships of Tarshish.
@703 As we have heard, so have we seen in the city of the Lord of hosts, in the city of our God, which God will establish forever. Selah
@704 We have thought on your steadfast love , O God, in the midst of your temple.
@705 As your name , O God, so your praise reaches to the ends of the earth. Your right hand is filled with righteousness.
@706 Let Mount Zion be glad! Let the daughters of Judah rejoice because of your judgments!
@707 Walk about Zion, go around her, number her towers,
@708 consider well her ramparts, go through her citadels, that you may tell the next generation
@709 that this is God, our God forever and ever. He will guide us forever.

@710 Why Should I Fear in Times of Trouble? To the choirmaster . A Psalm of the Sons of Korah. Hear this, all peoples! Give ear, all inhabitants of the world,
@711 both low and high, rich and poor together!
@712 My mouth shall speak wisdom; the meditation of my heart shall be understanding.
@713 I will incline my ear to a proverb; I will solve my riddle to the music of the lyre.
@714 Why should I fear in times of trouble, when the iniquity of those who cheat me surrounds me,
@715 those who trust in their wealth and boast of the abundance of their riches?
@716 Truly no man can ransom another, or give to God the price of his life,
@717 for the ransom of their life is costly and can never suffice,
@718 that he should live on forever and never see the pit.
@719 For he sees that even the wise die; the fool and the stupid alike must perish and leave their wealth to others.
@720 Their graves are their homes forever, their dwelling places to all generations, though they called lands by their own names.
@721 Man in his pomp will not remain; he is like the beasts that perish.
@722 This is the path of those who have foolish confidence; yet after them people approve of their boasts. Selah
@723 Like sheep they are appointed for Sheol; death shall be their shepherd, and the upright shall rule over them in the morning. Their form shall be consumed in Sheol , with no place to dwell.
@724 But God will ransom my soul from the power of Sheol, for he will receive me. Selah
@725 Be not afraid when a man becomes rich, when the glory of his house increases.
@726 For when he dies he will carry nothing away; his glory will not go down after him.
@727 For though, while he lives , he counts himself blessed —and though you get praise when you do well for yourself—
@728 his soul will go to the generation of his fathers, who will never again see light.
@729 Man in his pomp yet without understanding is like the beasts that perish.

@730 God Himself Is Judge A Psalm of Asaph. The Mighty One, God the Lord, speaks and summons the earth from the rising of the sun to its setting.
@731 Out of Zion, the perfection of beauty, God shines forth.
@732 Our God comes ; he does not keep silence; before him is a devouring fire, around him a mighty tempest.
@733 He calls to the heavens above and to the earth , that he may judge his people:
@734 Gather to me my faithful ones, who made a covenant with me by sacrifice!
@735 The heavens declare his righteousness, for God himself is judge! Selah
@736 Hear , O my people , and I will speak; O Israel , I will testify against you. I am God , your God.
@737 Not for your sacrifices do I rebuke you; your burnt offerings are continually before me.
@738 I will not accept a bull from your house or goats from your folds.
@739 For every beast of the forest is mine, the cattle on a thousand hills.
@740 I know all the birds of the hills, and all that moves in the field is mine.
@741 If I were hungry , I would not tell you, for the world and its fullness are mine.
@742 Do I eat the flesh of bulls or drink the blood of goats?
@743 Offer to God a sacrifice of thanksgiving, and perform your vows to the Most High,
@744 and call upon me in the day of trouble; I will deliver you, and you shall glorify me.
@745 But to the wicked God says: What right have you to recite my statutes or take my covenant on your lips?
@746 For you hate discipline, and you cast my words behind you.
@747 If you see a thief, you are pleased with him, and you keep company with adulterers.
@748 You give your mouth free rein for evil, and your tongue frames deceit.
@749 You sit and speak against your brother; you slander your own mother’s son.
@750 These things you have done , and I have been silent; you thought that I was one like yourself. But now I rebuke you and lay the charge before you.
@751 Mark this, then , you who forget God, lest I tear you apart , and there be none to deliver!
@752 The one who offers thanksgiving as his sacrifice glorifies me; to one who orders his way rightly I will show the salvation of God!

# 51
@753 Create in Me a Clean Heart, O God To the choirmaster . A Psalm of David , when Nathan the prophet went to him, after he had gone in to Bathsheba. Have mercy on me, O God, according to your steadfast love; according to your abundant mercy blot out my transgressions.
@754 Wash me thoroughly from my iniquity, and cleanse me from my sin!
@755 For I know my transgressions, and my sin is ever before me.
@756 Against you, you only , have I sinned and done what is evil in your sight, so that you may be justified in your words and blameless in your judgment.
@757 Behold, I was brought forth in iniquity, and in sin did my mother conceive me.
@758 Behold , you delight in truth in the inward being, and you teach me wisdom in the secret heart.
@759 Purge me with hyssop , and I shall be clean; wash me, and I shall be whiter than snow.
@760 Let me hear joy and gladness; let the bones that you have broken rejoice.
@761 Hide your face from my sins, and blot out all my iniquities.
@762 Create in me a clean heart , O God, and renew a right spirit within me.
@763 Cast me not away from your presence, and take not your Holy Spirit from me.
@764 Restore to me the joy of your salvation, and uphold me with a willing spirit.
@765 Then I will teach transgressors your ways, and sinners will return to you.
@766 Deliver me from bloodguiltiness , O God, O God of my salvation, and my tongue will sing aloud of your righteousness.
@767 O Lord, open my lips, and my mouth will declare your praise.
@768 For you will not delight in sacrifice , or I would give it; you will not be pleased with a burnt offering.
@769 The sacrifices of God are a broken spirit; a broken and contrite heart , O God , you will not despise.
@770 Do good to Zion in your good pleasure; build up the walls of Jerusalem;
@771 then will you delight in right sacrifices, in burnt offerings and whole burnt offerings; then bulls will be offered on your altar.

# 52
@772 The Steadfast Love of God Endures To the choirmaster . A Maskil of David , when Doeg , the Edomite, came and told Saul, David has come to the house of Ahimelech. Why do you boast of evil , O mighty man? The steadfast love of God endures all the day.
@773 Your tongue plots destruction, like a sharp razor , you worker of deceit.
@774 You love evil more than good, and lying more than speaking what is right. Selah
@775 You love all words that devour, O deceitful tongue.
@776 But God will break you down forever; he will snatch and tear you from your tent; he will uproot you from the land of the living. Selah
@777 The righteous shall see and fear, and shall laugh at him, saying,
@778 See the man who would not make God his refuge, but trusted in the abundance of his riches and sought refuge in his own destruction!
@779 But I am like a green olive tree in the house of God. I trust in the steadfast love of God forever and ever.
@780 I will thank you forever, because you have done it. I will wait for your name, for it is good, in the presence of the godly.

# 53
@781 There Is None Who Does Good To the choirmaster: according to Mahalath . A Maskil of David. The fool says in his heart, There is no God. They are corrupt , doing abominable iniquity; there is none who does good.
@782 God looks down from heaven on the children of man to see if there are any who understand, who seek after God.
@783 They have all fallen away; together they have become corrupt; there is none who does good, not even one.
@784 Have those who work evil no knowledge, who eat up my people as they eat bread, and do not call upon God?
@785 There they are, in great terror, where there is no terror! For God scatters the bones of him who encamps against you; you put them to shame, for God has rejected them.
@786 Oh, that salvation for Israel would come out of Zion! When God restores the fortunes of his people, let Jacob rejoice , let Israel be glad.

# 54
@787 The Lord Upholds My Life To the choirmaster : with stringed instruments . A Maskil of David, when the Ziphites went and told Saul, Is not David hiding among us? O God, save me by your name, and vindicate me by your might.
@788 O God, hear my prayer; give ear to the words of my mouth.
@789 For strangers have risen against me; ruthless men seek my life; they do not set God before themselves. Selah
@790 Behold, God is my helper; the Lord is the upholder of my life.
@791 He will return the evil to my enemies; in your faithfulness put an end to them.
@792 With a freewill offering I will sacrifice to you; I will give thanks to your name , O Lord, for it is good.
@793 For he has delivered me from every trouble, and my eye has looked in triumph on my enemies.

# 55
@794 Cast Your Burden on the Lord To the choirmaster : with stringed instruments . A Maskil of David. Give ear to my prayer , O God, and hide not yourself from my plea for mercy!
@795 Attend to me, and answer me; I am restless in my complaint and I moan,
@796 because of the noise of the enemy, because of the oppression of the wicked. For they drop trouble upon me, and in anger they bear a grudge against me.
@797 My heart is in anguish within me; the terrors of death have fallen upon me.
@798 Fear and trembling come upon me, and horror overwhelms me.
@799 And I say, Oh , that I had wings like a dove! I would fly away and be at rest;
@800 yes , I would wander far away; I would lodge in the wilderness; Selah
@801 I would hurry to find a shelter from the raging wind and tempest.
@802 Destroy , O Lord, divide their tongues; for I see violence and strife in the city.
@803 Day and night they go around it on its walls, and iniquity and trouble are within it;
@804 ruin is in its midst; oppression and fraud do not depart from its marketplace.
@805 For it is not an enemy who taunts me— then I could bear it; it is not an adversary who deals insolently with me— then I could hide from him.
@806 But it is you, a man , my equal, my companion , my familiar friend.
@807 We used to take sweet counsel together; within God’s house we walked in the throng.
@808 Let death steal over them; let them go down to Sheol alive; for evil is in their dwelling place and in their heart.
@809 But I call to God, and the Lord will save me.
@810 Evening and morning and at noon I utter my complaint and moan, and he hears my voice.
@811 He redeems my soul in safety from the battle that I wage, for many are arrayed against me.
@812 God will give ear and humble them, he who is enthroned from of old, Selah because they do not change and do not fear God.
@813 My companion stretched out his hand against his friends; he violated his covenant.
@814 His speech was smooth as butter, yet war was in his heart; his words were softer than oil, yet they were drawn swords.
@815 Cast your burden on the Lord, and he will sustain you; he will never permit the righteous to be moved.
@816 But you, O God, will cast them down into the pit of destruction; men of blood and treachery shall not live out half their days. But I will trust in you.

# 56
@817 In God I Trust To the choirmaster: according to The Dove on Far-off Terebinths . A Miktam of David , when the Philistines seized him in Gath. Be gracious to me, O God, for man tramples on me; all day long an attacker oppresses me;
@818 my enemies trample on me all day long, for many attack me proudly.
@819 When I am afraid, I put my trust in you.
@820 In God , whose word I praise, in God I trust; I shall not be afraid. What can flesh do to me?
@821 All day long they injure my cause; all their thoughts are against me for evil.
@822 They stir up strife , they lurk; they watch my steps, as they have waited for my life.
@823 For their crime will they escape? In wrath cast down the peoples , O God!
@824 You have kept count of my tossings; put my tears in your bottle. Are they not in your book?
@825 Then my enemies will turn back in the day when I call. This I know, that God is for me.
@826 In God , whose word I praise, in the Lord , whose word I praise,
@827 in God I trust; I shall not be afraid. What can man do to me?
@828 I must perform my vows to you, O God; I will render thank offerings to you.
@829 For you have delivered my soul from death, yes , my feet from falling, that I may walk before God in the light of life.

# 57
@830 Let Your Glory Be over All the Earth To the choirmaster: according to Do Not Destroy . A Miktam of David , when he fled from Saul , in the cave. Be merciful to me, O God , be merciful to me, for in you my soul takes refuge; in the shadow of your wings I will take refuge, till the storms of destruction pass by.
@831 I cry out to God Most High, to God who fulfills his purpose for me.
@832 He will send from heaven and save me; he will put to shame him who tramples on me. Selah God will send out his steadfast love and his faithfulness!
@833 My soul is in the midst of lions; I lie down amid fiery beasts — the children of man , whose teeth are spears and arrows, whose tongues are sharp swords.
@834 Be exalted , O God, above the heavens! Let your glory be over all the earth!
@835 They set a net for my steps; my soul was bowed down. They dug a pit in my way, but they have fallen into it themselves. Selah
@836 My heart is steadfast , O God, my heart is steadfast! I will sing and make melody!
@837 Awake, my glory! Awake, O harp and lyre! I will awake the dawn!
@838 I will give thanks to you, O Lord , among the peoples; I will sing praises to you among the nations.
@839 For your steadfast love is great to the heavens, your faithfulness to the clouds.
@840 Be exalted , O God, above the heavens! Let your glory be over all the earth!

# 58
@841 God Who Judges the Earth To the choirmaster: according to Do Not Destroy . A Miktam of David. Do you indeed decree what is right , you gods? Do you judge the children of man uprightly?
@842 No , in your hearts you devise wrongs; your hands deal out violence on earth.
@843 The wicked are estranged from the womb; they go astray from birth, speaking lies.
@844 They have venom like the venom of a serpent, like the deaf adder that stops its ear,
@845 so that it does not hear the voice of charmers or of the cunning enchanter.
@846 O God, break the teeth in their mouths; tear out the fangs of the young lions , O Lord!
@847 Let them vanish like water that runs away; when he aims his arrows , let them be blunted.
@848 Let them be like the snail that dissolves into slime, like the stillborn child who never sees the sun.
@849 Sooner than your pots can feel the heat of thorns, whether green or ablaze , may he sweep them away!
@850 The righteous will rejoice when he sees the vengeance; he will bathe his feet in the blood of the wicked.
@851 Mankind will say, Surely there is a reward for the righteous; surely there is a God who judges on earth.

@852 Deliver Me from My Enemies To the choirmaster: according to Do Not Destroy . A Miktam of David, when Saul sent men to watch his house in order to kill him. Deliver me from my enemies , O my God; protect me from those who rise up against me;
@853 deliver me from those who work evil, and save me from bloodthirsty men.
@854 For behold , they lie in wait for my life; fierce men stir up strife against me. For no transgression or sin of mine, O Lord,
@855 for no fault of mine, they run and make ready. Awake , come to meet me, and see!
@856 You, Lord God of hosts , are God of Israel. Rouse yourself to punish all the nations; spare none of those who treacherously plot evil. Selah
@857 Each evening they come back, howling like dogs and prowling about the city.
@858 There they are, bellowing with their mouths with swords in their lips — for Who, they think, will hear us?
@859 But you, O Lord, laugh at them; you hold all the nations in derision.
@860 O my Strength , I will watch for you, for you, O God , are my fortress.
@861 My God in his steadfast love will meet me; God will let me look in triumph on my enemies.
@862 Kill them not, lest my people forget; make them totter by your power and bring them down, O Lord , our shield!
@863 For the sin of their mouths , the words of their lips, let them be trapped in their pride. For the cursing and lies that they utter,
@864 consume them in wrath; consume them till they are no more, that they may know that God rules over Jacob to the ends of the earth. Selah
@865 Each evening they come back, howling like dogs and prowling about the city.
@866 They wander about for food and growl if they do not get their fill.
@867 But I will sing of your strength; I will sing aloud of your steadfast love in the morning. For you have been to me a fortress and a refuge in the day of my distress.
@868 O my Strength , I will sing praises to you, for you, O God, are my fortress, the God who shows me steadfast love.

@869 He Will Tread Down Our Foes To the choirmaster: according to Shushan Eduth . A Miktam of David; for instruction ; when he strove with Aram-naharaim and with Aram-zobah , and when Joab on his return struck down twelve thousand of Edom in the Valley of Salt. O God, you have rejected us, broken our defenses; you have been angry; oh, restore us.
@870 You have made the land to quake ; you have torn it open; repair its breaches, for it totters.
@871 You have made your people see hard things; you have given us wine to drink that made us stagger.
@872 You have set up a banner for those who fear you, that they may flee to it from the bow. Selah
@873 That your beloved ones may be delivered, give salvation by your right hand and answer us!
@874 God has spoken in his holiness: With exultation I will divide up Shechem and portion out the Vale of Succoth.
@875 Gilead is mine; Manasseh is mine; Ephraim is my helmet; Judah is my scepter.
@876 Moab is my washbasin; upon Edom I cast my shoe; over Philistia I shout in triumph.
@877 Who will bring me to the fortified city? Who will lead me to Edom?
@878 Have you not rejected us, O God? You do not go forth , O God , with our armies.
@879 Oh, grant us help against the foe, for vain is the salvation of man!
@880 With God we shall do valiantly; it is he who will tread down our foes.

@882 from the end of the earth I call to you when my heart is faint. Lead me to the rock that is higher than I,
@883 for you have been my refuge, a strong tower against the enemy.
@884 Let me dwell in your tent forever! Let me take refuge under the shelter of your wings! Selah
@885 For you, O God , have heard my vows; you have given me the heritage of those who fear your name.
@886 Prolong the life of the king; may his years endure to all generations!
@887 May he be enthroned forever before God; appoint steadfast love and faithfulness to watch over him!
@888 So will I ever sing praises to your name, as I perform my vows day after day.

@890 He alone is my rock and my salvation, my fortress; I shall not be greatly shaken.
@891 How long will all of you attack a man to batter him, like a leaning wall , a tottering fence?
@892 They only plan to thrust him down from his high position. They take pleasure in falsehood. They bless with their mouths, but inwardly they curse. Selah
@893 For God alone , O my soul , wait in silence, for my hope is from him.
@894 He only is my rock and my salvation, my fortress ; I shall not be shaken.
@895 On God rests my salvation and my glory; my mighty rock, my refuge is God.
@896 Trust in him at all times , O people; pour out your heart before him; God is a refuge for us. Selah
@897 Those of low estate are but a breath; those of high estate are a delusion; in the balances they go up; they are together lighter than a breath.
@898 Put no trust in extortion; set no vain hopes on robbery; if riches increase, set not your heart on them.
@899 Once God has spoken; twice have I heard this: that power belongs to God,
@900 and that to you, O Lord, belongs steadfast love. For you will render to a man according to his work.

@901 My Soul Thirsts for You A Psalm of David, when he was in the wilderness of Judah. O God , you are my God; earnestly I seek you; my soul thirsts for you; my flesh faints for you, as in a dry and weary land where there is no water.
@902 So I have looked upon you in the sanctuary, beholding your power and glory.
@903 Because your steadfast love is better than life, my lips will praise you.
@904 So I will bless you as long as I live; in your name I will lift up my hands.
@905 My soul will be satisfied as with fat and rich food, and my mouth will praise you with joyful lips,
@906 when I remember you upon my bed, and meditate on you in the watches of the night;
@907 for you have been my help, and in the shadow of your wings I will sing for joy.
@908 My soul clings to you; your right hand upholds me.
@909 But those who seek to destroy my life shall go down into the depths of the earth;
@910 they shall be given over to the power of the sword; they shall be a portion for jackals.
@911 But the king shall rejoice in God; all who swear by him shall exult, for the mouths of liars will be stopped.

# 64
@912 Hide Me from the Wicked To the choirmaster . A Psalm of David. Hear my voice , O God , in my complaint; preserve my life from dread of the enemy.
@913 Hide me from the secret plots of the wicked, from the throng of evildoers,
@914 who whet their tongues like swords, who aim bitter words like arrows,
@915 shooting from ambush at the blameless, shooting at him suddenly and without fear.
@916 They hold fast to their evil purpose; they talk of laying snares secretly, thinking, Who can see them?
@917 They search out injustice, saying, We have accomplished a diligent search. For the inward mind and heart of a man are deep.
@918 But God shoots his arrow at them; they are wounded suddenly.
@919 They are brought to ruin , with their own tongues turned against them; all who see them will wag their heads.
@920 Then all mankind fears; they tell what God has brought about and ponder what he has done.
@921 Let the righteous one rejoice in the Lord and take refuge in him! Let all the upright in heart exult!

@922 O God of Our Salvation To the choirmaster . A Psalm of David . A Song. Praise is due to you, O God , in Zion, and to you shall vows be performed.
@923 O you who hear prayer, to you shall all flesh come.
@924 When iniquities prevail against me, you atone for our transgressions.
@925 Blessed is the one you choose and bring near, to dwell in your courts! We shall be satisfied with the goodness of your house, the holiness of your temple!
@926 By awesome deeds you answer us with righteousness, O God of our salvation, the hope of all the ends of the earth and of the farthest seas;
@927 the one who by his strength established the mountains, being girded with might;
@928 who stills the roaring of the seas, the roaring of their waves, the tumult of the peoples,
@929 so that those who dwell at the ends of the earth are in awe at your signs. You make the going out of the morning and the evening to shout for joy.
@930 You visit the earth and water it; you greatly enrich it; the river of God is full of water; you provide their grain, for so you have prepared it.
@931 You water its furrows abundantly, settling its ridges, softening it with showers, and blessing its growth.
@932 You crown the year with your bounty; your wagon tracks overflow with abundance.
@933 The pastures of the wilderness overflow, the hills gird themselves with joy,
@934 the meadows clothe themselves with flocks, the valleys deck themselves with grain, they shout and sing together for joy.

@938 All the earth worships you and sings praises to you; they sing praises to your name. Selah
@939 Come and see what God has done: he is awesome in his deeds toward the children of man.
@940 He turned the sea into dry land; they passed through the river on foot. There did we rejoice in him,
@941 who rules by his might forever, whose eyes keep watch on the nations — let not the rebellious exalt themselves. Selah
@942 Bless our God , O peoples; let the sound of his praise be heard,
@943 who has kept our soul among the living and has not let our feet slip.
@944 For you, O God , have tested us; you have tried us as silver is tried.
@945 You brought us into the net; you laid a crushing burden on our backs;
@946 you let men ride over our heads; we went through fire and through water; yet you have brought us out to a place of abundance.
@947 I will come into your house with burnt offerings; I will perform my vows to you,
@948 that which my lips uttered and my mouth promised when I was in trouble.
@949 I will offer to you burnt offerings of fattened animals, with the smoke of the sacrifice of rams; I will make an offering of bulls and goats. Selah
@950 Come and hear, all you who fear God, and I will tell what he has done for my soul.
@951 I cried to him with my mouth, and high praise was on my tongue.
@952 If I had cherished iniquity in my heart, the Lord would not have listened.
@953 But truly God has listened; he has attended to the voice of my prayer.
@954 Blessed be God, because he has not rejected my prayer or removed his steadfast love from me!

@963 As smoke is driven away , so you shall drive them away; as wax melts before fire, so the wicked shall perish before God!
@964 But the righteous shall be glad; they shall exult before God; they shall be jubilant with joy!
@965 Sing to God, sing praises to his name; lift up a song to him who rides through the deserts; his name is the Lord; exult before him!
@966 Father of the fatherless and protector of widows is God in his holy habitation.
@967 God settles the solitary in a home; he leads out the prisoners to prosperity, but the rebellious dwell in a parched land.
@968 O God , when you went out before your people, when you marched through the wilderness, Selah
@969 the earth quaked, the heavens poured down rain, before God , the One of Sinai, before God , the God of Israel.
@970 Rain in abundance , O God , you shed abroad; you restored your inheritance as it languished;
@971 your flock found a dwelling in it; in your goodness , O God , you provided for the needy.
@972 The Lord gives the word; the women who announce the news are a great host:
@973 The kings of the armies —they flee , they flee! The women at home divide the spoil —
@974 though you men lie among the sheepfolds — the wings of a dove covered with silver, its pinions with shimmering gold.
@975 When the Almighty scatters kings there, let snow fall on Zalmon.
@976 O mountain of God, mountain of Bashan; O many-peaked mountain, mountain of Bashan!
@977 Why do you look with hatred , O many-peaked mountain, at the mount that God desired for his abode, yes , where the Lord will dwell forever?
@978 The chariots of God are twice ten thousand, thousands upon thousands; the Lord is among them; Sinai is now in the sanctuary.
@979 You ascended on high, leading a host of captives in your train and receiving gifts among men, even among the rebellious, that the Lord God may dwell there.
@980 Blessed be the Lord, who daily bears us up; God is our salvation. Selah
@981 Our God is a God of salvation, and to God , the Lord , belong deliverances from death.
@982 But God will strike the heads of his enemies, the hairy crown of him who walks in his guilty ways.
@983 The Lord said, I will bring them back from Bashan, I will bring them back from the depths of the sea,
@984 that you may strike your feet in their blood, that the tongues of your dogs may have their portion from the foe.
@985 Your procession is seen , O God, the procession of my God , my King , into the sanctuary —
@986 the singers in front, the musicians last, between them virgins playing tambourines:
@987 Bless God in the great congregation, the Lord , O you who are of Israel’s fountain!
@988 There is Benjamin , the least of them, in the lead, the princes of Judah in their throng, the princes of Zebulun , the princes of Naphtali.
@989 Summon your power , O God, the power , O God , by which you have worked for us.
@990 Because of your temple at Jerusalem kings shall bear gifts to you.
@991 Rebuke the beasts that dwell among the reeds, the herd of bulls with the calves of the peoples. Trample underfoot those who lust after tribute; scatter the peoples who delight in war.
@992 Nobles shall come from Egypt; Cush shall hasten to stretch out her hands to God.
@993 O kingdoms of the earth, sing to God; sing praises to the Lord, Selah
@994 to him who rides in the heavens , the ancient heavens; behold , he sends out his voice , his mighty voice.
@995 Ascribe power to God, whose majesty is over Israel, and whose power is in the skies.
@996 Awesome is God from his sanctuary; the God of Israel —he is the one who gives power and strength to his people. Blessed be God!

@997 Save Me, O God To the choirmaster : according to Lilies . Of David. Save me, O God! For the waters have come up to my neck.
@998 I sink in deep mire, where there is no foothold; I have come into deep waters, and the flood sweeps over me.
@999 I am weary with my crying out; my throat is parched. My eyes grow dim with waiting for my God.
@1000 More in number than the hairs of my head are those who hate me without cause; mighty are those who would destroy me, those who attack me with lies. What I did not steal must I now restore?
@1001 O God , you know my folly; the wrongs I have done are not hidden from you.
@1002 Let not those who hope in you be put to shame through me, O Lord God of hosts; let not those who seek you be brought to dishonor through me, O God of Israel.
@1003 For it is for your sake that I have borne reproach, that dishonor has covered my face.
@1004 I have become a stranger to my brothers, an alien to my mother’s sons.
@1005 For zeal for your house has consumed me, and the reproaches of those who reproach you have fallen on me.
@1006 When I wept and humbled my soul with fasting, it became my reproach.
@1007 When I made sackcloth my clothing, I became a byword to them.
@1008 I am the talk of those who sit in the gate, and the drunkards songs about me.
@1009 But as for me, my prayer is to you, O Lord. At an acceptable time , O God, in the abundance of your steadfast love answer me in your saving faithfulness.
@1010 Deliver me from sinking in the mire; let me be delivered from my enemies and from the deep waters.
@1011 Let not the flood sweep over me, or the deep swallow me up, or the pit close its mouth over me.
@1012 Answer me, O Lord , for your steadfast love is good; according to your abundant mercy, turn to me.
@1013 Hide not your face from your servant; for I am in distress; make haste to answer me.
@1014 Draw near to my soul, redeem me; ransom me because of my enemies!
@1015 You know my reproach, and my shame and my dishonor; my foes are all known to you.
@1016 Reproaches have broken my heart, so that I am in despair. I looked for pity , but there was none, and for comforters , but I found none.
@1017 They gave me poison for food, and for my thirst they gave me sour wine to drink.
@1018 Let their own table before them become a snare; and when they are at peace , let it become a trap.
@1019 Let their eyes be darkened , so that they cannot see, and make their loins tremble continually.
@1020 Pour out your indignation upon them, and let your burning anger overtake them.
@1021 May their camp be a desolation; let no one dwell in their tents.
@1022 For they persecute him whom you have struck down, and they recount the pain of those you have wounded.
@1023 Add to them punishment upon punishment; may they have no acquittal from you.
@1024 Let them be blotted out of the book of the living; let them not be enrolled among the righteous.
@1025 But I am afflicted and in pain; let your salvation , O God, set me on high!
@1026 I will praise the name of God with a song; I will magnify him with thanksgiving.
@1027 This will please the Lord more than an ox or a bull with horns and hoofs.
@1028 When the humble see it they will be glad; you who seek God, let your hearts revive.
@1029 For the Lord hears the needy and does not despise his own people who are prisoners.
@1030 Let heaven and earth praise him, the seas and everything that moves in them.
@1031 For God will save Zion and build up the cities of Judah, and people shall dwell there and possess it;
@1032 the offspring of his servants shall inherit it, and those who love his name shall dwell in it.

@1042 For you, O Lord , are my hope, my trust , O Lord, from my youth.
@1043 Upon you I have leaned from before my birth; you are he who took me from my mother’s womb. My praise is continually of you.
@1044 I have been as a portent to many, but you are my strong refuge.
@1045 My mouth is filled with your praise, and with your glory all the day.
@1046 Do not cast me off in the time of old age; forsake me not when my strength is spent.
@1047 For my enemies speak concerning me; those who watch for my life consult together
@1048 and say, God has forsaken him; pursue and seize him, for there is none to deliver him.
@1049 O God , be not far from me; O my God, make haste to help me!
@1050 May my accusers be put to shame and consumed; with scorn and disgrace may they be covered who seek my hurt.
@1051 But I will hope continually and will praise you yet more and more.
@1052 My mouth will tell of your righteous acts, of your deeds of salvation all the day, for their number is past my knowledge.
@1053 With the mighty deeds of the Lord God I will come; I will remind them of your righteousness , yours alone.
@1054 O God, from my youth you have taught me, and I still proclaim your wondrous deeds.
@1055 So even to old age and gray hairs, O God, do not forsake me, until I proclaim your might to another generation, your power to all those to come.
@1056 Your righteousness , O God, reaches the high heavens. You who have done great things, O God, who is like you?
@1057 You who have made me see many troubles and calamities will revive me again; from the depths of the earth you will bring me up again.
@1058 You will increase my greatness and comfort me again.
@1059 I will also praise you with the harp for your faithfulness , O my God; I will sing praises to you with the lyre, O Holy One of Israel.
@1060 My lips will shout for joy, when I sing praises to you; my soul also, which you have redeemed.
@1061 And my tongue will talk of your righteous help all the day long, for they have been put to shame and disappointed who sought to do me hurt.

@1071 May the kings of Tarshish and of the coastlands render him tribute; may the kings of Sheba and Seba bring gifts!

@1082 God Is My Strength and Portion Forever A Psalm of Asaph. Truly God is good to Israel, to those who are pure in heart.
@1083 But as for me, my feet had almost stumbled, my steps had nearly slipped.
@1084 For I was envious of the arrogant when I saw the prosperity of the wicked.
@1085 For they have no pangs until death; their bodies are fat and sleek.
@1086 They are not in trouble as others are; they are not stricken like the rest of mankind.
@1087 Therefore pride is their necklace; violence covers them as a garment.
@1088 Their eyes swell out through fatness; their hearts overflow with follies.
@1089 They scoff and speak with malice; loftily they threaten oppression.
@1090 They set their mouths against the heavens, and their tongue struts through the earth.
@1091 Therefore his people turn back to them, and find no fault in them.
@1092 And they say, How can God know? Is there knowledge in the Most High?
@1093 Behold , these are the wicked; always at ease , they increase in riches.
@1094 All in vain have I kept my heart clean and washed my hands in innocence.
@1095 For all the day long I have been stricken and rebuked every morning.
@1096 If I had said, I will speak thus, I would have betrayed the generation of your children.
@1097 But when I thought how to understand this, it seemed to me a wearisome task,
@1098 until I went into the sanctuary of God; then I discerned their end.
@1099 Truly you set them in slippery places; you make them fall to ruin.
@1100 How they are destroyed in a moment, swept away utterly by terrors!
@1101 Like a dream when one awakes, O Lord , when you rouse yourself , you despise them as phantoms.
@1102 When my soul was embittered, when I was pricked in heart,
@1103 I was brutish and ignorant; I was like a beast toward you.
@1104 Nevertheless, I am continually with you; you hold my right hand.
@1105 You guide me with your counsel, and afterward you will receive me to glory.
@1106 Whom have I in heaven but you? And there is nothing on earth that I desire besides you.
@1107 My flesh and my heart may fail, but God is the strength of my heart and my portion forever.
@1108 For behold , those who are far from you shall perish; you put an end to everyone who is unfaithful to you.
@1109 But for me it is good to be near God; I have made the Lord God my refuge, that I may tell of all your works.

@1111 Remember your congregation , which you have purchased of old, which you have redeemed to be the tribe of your heritage! Remember Mount Zion, where you have dwelt.
@1112 Direct your steps to the perpetual ruins; the enemy has destroyed everything in the sanctuary!

@1114 They were like those who swing axes in a forest of trees.
@1115 And all its carved wood they broke down with hatchets and hammers.
@1116 They set your sanctuary on fire; they profaned the dwelling place of your name, bringing it down to the ground.
@1117 They said to themselves, We will utterly subdue them; they burned all the meeting places of God in the land.
@1118 We do not see our signs; there is no longer any prophet, and there is none among us who knows how long.
@1119 How long , O God, is the foe to scoff? Is the enemy to revile your name forever?
@1120 Why do you hold back your hand , your right hand? Take it from the fold of your garment and destroy them!
@1121 Yet God my King is from of old, working salvation in the midst of the earth.
@1122 You divided the sea by your might; you broke the heads of the sea monsters on the waters.
@1123 You crushed the heads of Leviathan; you gave him as food for the creatures of the wilderness.
@1124 You split open springs and brooks; you dried up ever-flowing streams.
@1125 Yours is the day , yours also the night; you have established the heavenly lights and the sun.
@1126 You have fixed all the boundaries of the earth; you have made summer and winter.
@1127 Remember this , O Lord , how the enemy scoffs, and a foolish people reviles your name.
@1128 Do not deliver the soul of your dove to the wild beasts; do not forget the life of your poor forever.
@1129 Have regard for the covenant, for the dark places of the land are full of the habitations of violence.
@1130 Let not the downtrodden turn back in shame; let the poor and needy praise your name.
@1131 Arise , O God, defend your cause; remember how the foolish scoff at you all the day!
@1132 Do not forget the clamor of your foes, the uproar of those who rise against you, which goes up continually!

@1133 God Will Judge with Equity To the choirmaster: according to Do Not Destroy. A Psalm of Asaph . A Song. We give thanks to you, O God; we give thanks , for your name is near. We recount your wondrous deeds.
@1134 At the set time that I appoint I will judge with equity.
@1135 When the earth totters , and all its inhabitants, it is I who keep steady its pillars. Selah
@1136 I say to the boastful, Do not boast, and to the wicked, Do not lift up your horn;
@1137 do not lift up your horn on high, or speak with haughty neck.
@1138 For not from the east or from the west and not from the wilderness comes lifting up,
@1139 but it is God who executes judgment, putting down one and lifting up another.
@1140 For in the hand of the Lord there is a cup with foaming wine, well mixed, and he pours out from it, and all the wicked of the earth shall drain it down to the dregs.
@1141 But I will declare it forever; I will sing praises to the God of Jacob.
@1142 All the horns of the wicked I will cut off, but the horns of the righteous shall be lifted up.

@1143 Who Can Stand Before You? To the choirmaster : with stringed instruments . A Psalm of Asaph . A Song. In Judah God is known; his name is great in Israel.
@1144 His abode has been established in Salem, his dwelling place in Zion.
@1145 There he broke the flashing arrows, the shield , the sword , and the weapons of war. Selah
@1146 Glorious are you, more majestic than the mountains full of prey.
@1147 The stouthearted were stripped of their spoil; they sank into sleep; all the men of war were unable to use their hands.
@1148 At your rebuke , O God of Jacob, rider and horse lay stunned.
@1149 But you, you are to be feared! Who can stand before you when once your anger is roused?
@1150 From the heavens you uttered judgment; the earth feared and was still,
@1151 when God arose to establish judgment, to save all the humble of the earth. Selah
@1152 Surely the wrath of man shall praise you; the remnant of wrath you will put on like a belt.
@1153 Make your vows to the Lord your God and perform them; let all around him bring gifts to him who is to be feared,
@1154 who cuts off the spirit of princes, who is to be feared by the kings of the earth.

@1155 In the Day of Trouble I Seek the Lord To the choirmaster: according to Jeduthun . A Psalm of Asaph. I cry aloud to God, aloud to God , and he will hear me.
@1156 In the day of my trouble I seek the Lord; in the night my hand is stretched out without wearying; my soul refuses to be comforted.
@1157 When I remember God , I moan; when I meditate , my spirit faints. Selah
@1158 You hold my eyelids open; I am so troubled that I cannot speak.
@1159 I consider the days of old, the years long ago.
@1160 I said, Let me remember my song in the night; let me meditate in my heart. Then my spirit made a diligent search:
@1161 Will the Lord spurn forever, and never again be favorable?
@1162 Has his steadfast love forever ceased? Are his promises at an end for all time?
@1163 Has God forgotten to be gracious? Has he in anger shut up his compassion? Selah
@1164 Then I said, I will appeal to this, to the years of the right hand of the Most High.
@1165 I will remember the deeds of the Lord; yes , I will remember your wonders of old.
@1166 I will ponder all your work, and meditate on your mighty deeds.
@1167 Your way , O God , is holy. What god is great like our God?
@1168 You are the God who works wonders; you have made known your might among the peoples.
@1169 You with your arm redeemed your people, the children of Jacob and Joseph. Selah
@1170 When the waters saw you, O God, when the waters saw you, they were afraid; indeed , the deep trembled.
@1171 The clouds poured out water; the skies gave forth thunder; your arrows flashed on every side.
@1172 The crash of your thunder was in the whirlwind; your lightnings lighted up the world; the earth trembled and shook.
@1173 Your way was through the sea, your path through the great waters; yet your footprints were unseen.
@1174 You led your people like a flock by the hand of Moses and Aaron.

# 78
@1175 Tell the Coming Generation A Maskil of Asaph. Give ear , O my people , to my teaching; incline your ears to the words of my mouth!
@1176 I will open my mouth in a parable; I will utter dark sayings from of old,
@1177 things that we have heard and known, that our fathers have told us.
@1178 We will not hide them from their children, but tell to the coming generation the glorious deeds of the Lord , and his might, and the wonders that he has done.
@1179 He established a testimony in Jacob and appointed a law in Israel, which he commanded our fathers to teach to their children,
@1180 that the next generation might know them, the children yet unborn, and arise and tell them to their children,
@1181 so that they should set their hope in God and not forget the works of God, but keep his commandments;
@1182 and that they should not be like their fathers, a stubborn and rebellious generation, a generation whose heart was not steadfast, whose spirit was not faithful to God.
@1183 The Ephraimites, armed with the bow, turned back on the day of battle.
@1184 They did not keep God’s covenant, but refused to walk according to his law.
@1185 They forgot his works and the wonders that he had shown them.
@1186 In the sight of their fathers he performed wonders in the land of Egypt , in the fields of Zoan.
@1187 He divided the sea and let them pass through it, and made the waters stand like a heap.
@1188 In the daytime he led them with a cloud, and all the night with a fiery light.
@1189 He split rocks in the wilderness and gave them drink abundantly as from the deep.
@1190 He made streams come out of the rock and caused waters to flow down like rivers.
@1191 Yet they sinned still more against him, rebelling against the Most High in the desert.
@1192 They tested God in their heart by demanding the food they craved.
@1193 They spoke against God, saying, Can God spread a table in the wilderness?
@1194 He struck the rock so that water gushed out and streams overflowed. Can he also give bread or provide meat for his people?
@1195 Therefore , when the Lord heard , he was full of wrath; a fire was kindled against Jacob; his anger rose against Israel,
@1196 because they did not believe in God and did not trust his saving power.
@1197 Yet he commanded the skies above and opened the doors of heaven,
@1198 and he rained down on them manna to eat and gave them the grain of heaven.
@1199 Man ate of the bread of the angels; he sent them food in abundance.
@1200 He caused the east wind to blow in the heavens, and by his power he led out the south wind;
@1201 he rained meat on them like dust, winged birds like the sand of the seas;
@1202 he let them fall in the midst of their camp, all around their dwellings.
@1203 And they ate and were well filled, for he gave them what they craved.
@1204 But before they had satisfied their craving, while the food was still in their mouths,
@1205 the anger of God rose against them, and he killed the strongest of them and laid low the young men of Israel.
@1206 In spite of all this , they still sinned; despite his wonders , they did not believe.
@1207 So he made their days vanish like a breath, and their years in terror.
@1208 When he killed them, they sought him; they repented and sought God earnestly.
@1209 They remembered that God was their rock, the Most High God their redeemer.
@1210 But they flattered him with their mouths; they lied to him with their tongues.
@1211 Their heart was not steadfast toward him; they were not faithful to his covenant.
@1212 Yet he, being compassionate, atoned for their iniquity and did not destroy them; he restrained his anger often and did not stir up all his wrath.
@1213 He remembered that they were but flesh, a wind that passes and comes not again.
@1214 How often they rebelled against him in the wilderness and grieved him in the desert!
@1215 They tested God again and again and provoked the Holy One of Israel.
@1216 They did not remember his power or the day when he redeemed them from the foe,
@1217 when he performed his signs in Egypt and his marvels in the fields of Zoan.
@1218 He turned their rivers to blood, so that they could not drink of their streams.
@1219 He sent among them swarms of flies , which devoured them, and frogs , which destroyed them.
@1220 He gave their crops to the destroying locust and the fruit of their labor to the locust.
@1221 He destroyed their vines with hail and their sycamores with frost.
@1222 He gave over their cattle to the hail and their flocks to thunderbolts.
@1223 He let loose on them his burning anger, wrath, indignation , and distress, a company of destroying angels.
@1224 He made a path for his anger; he did not spare them from death, but gave their lives over to the plague.
@1225 He struck down every firstborn in Egypt, the firstfruits of their strength in the tents of Ham.
@1226 Then he led out his people like sheep and guided them in the wilderness like a flock.
@1227 He led them in safety , so that they were not afraid, but the sea overwhelmed their enemies.
@1228 And he brought them to his holy land, to the mountain which his right hand had won.
@1229 He drove out nations before them; he apportioned them for a possession and settled the tribes of Israel in their tents.
@1230 Yet they tested and rebelled against the Most High God and did not keep his testimonies,
@1231 but turned away and acted treacherously like their fathers; they twisted like a deceitful bow.
@1232 For they provoked him to anger with their high places; they moved him to jealousy with their idols.
@1233 When God heard , he was wrath, and he utterly rejected Israel.
@1234 He forsook his dwelling at Shiloh, the tent where he dwelt among mankind,
@1235 and delivered his power to captivity, his glory to the hand of the foe.
@1236 He gave his people over to the sword and vented his wrath on his heritage.
@1237 Fire devoured their young men, and their young women had no marriage song.
@1238 Their priests fell by the sword, and their widows made no lamentation.
@1239 Then the Lord awoke as from sleep, like a strong man shouting because of wine.
@1240 And he put his adversaries to rout; he put them to everlasting shame.
@1241 He rejected the tent of Joseph; he did not choose the tribe of Ephraim,
@1242 but he chose the tribe of Judah, Mount Zion, which he loves.
@1243 He built his sanctuary like the high heavens, like the earth , which he has founded forever.
@1244 He chose David his servant and took him from the sheepfolds;
@1245 from following the nursing ewes he brought him to shepherd Jacob his people, Israel his inheritance.
@1246 With upright heart he shepherded them and guided them with his skillful hand.

@1247 How Long, O Lord? A Psalm of Asaph. O God, the nations have come into your inheritance; they have defiled your holy temple; they have laid Jerusalem in ruins.
@1248 They have given the bodies of your servants to the birds of the heavens for food, the flesh of your faithful to the beasts of the earth.
@1249 They have poured out their blood like water all around Jerusalem, and there was no one to bury them.
@1250 We have a taunt to our neighbors, mocked and derided by those around us.
@1251 How long , O Lord ? Will you be angry forever? Will your jealousy burn like fire?
@1252 Pour out your anger on the nations that do not know you, and on the kingdoms that do not call upon your name!
@1253 For they have devoured Jacob and laid waste his habitation.
@1254 Do not remember against us our former iniquities; let your compassion come speedily to meet us, for we are brought very low.
@1255 Help us, O God of our salvation, for the glory of your name; deliver us, and atone for our sins, for your name’s sake!
@1256 Why should the nations say, Where is their God? Let the avenging of the outpoured blood of your servants be known among the nations before our eyes!
@1257 Let the groans of the prisoners come before you; according to your great power, preserve those doomed to die!
@1258 Return sevenfold into the lap of our neighbors the taunts with which they have taunted you, O Lord!
@1259 But we your people , the sheep of your pasture, will give thanks to you forever; from generation to generation we will recount your praise.

@1261 Before Ephraim and Benjamin and Manasseh, stir up your might and come to save us!
@1262 Restore us, O God; let your face shine , that we may be saved!
@1263 O Lord God of hosts, how long will you be angry with your people’s prayers?
@1264 You have fed them with the bread of tears and given them tears to drink in full measure.
@1265 You make us an object of contention for our neighbors, and our enemies laugh among themselves.
@1266 Restore us, O God of hosts; let your face shine , that we may be saved!
@1267 You brought a vine out of Egypt; you drove out the nations and planted it.
@1268 You cleared the ground for it; it took deep root and filled the land.
@1269 The mountains were covered with its shade, the mighty cedars with its branches.
@1270 It sent out its branches to the sea and its shoots to the River.
@1271 Why then have you broken down its walls, so that all who pass along the way pluck its fruit?
@1272 The boar from the forest ravages it, and all that move in the field feed on it.
@1273 Turn again , O God of hosts! Look down from heaven , and see; have regard for this vine,
@1274 the stock that your right hand planted, and for the son whom you made strong for yourself.
@1275 They have burned it with fire ; they have cut it down; may they perish at the rebuke of your face!
@1276 But let your hand be on the man of your right hand, the son of man whom you have made strong for yourself!
@1277 Then we shall not turn back from you; give us life , and we will call upon your name!
@1278 Restore us, O Lord God of hosts! Let your face shine , that we may be saved!

@1280 Raise a song; sound the tambourine, the sweet lyre with the harp.
@1281 Blow the trumpet at the new moon, at the full moon , on our feast day.
@1282 For it is a statute for Israel, a rule of the God of Jacob.
@1283 He made it a decree in Joseph when he went out over the land of Egypt. I hear a language I had not known:
@1284 I relieved your shoulder of the burden; your hands were freed from the basket.
@1285 In distress you called , and I delivered you; I answered you in the secret place of thunder; I tested you at the waters of Meribah. Selah
@1286 Hear , O my people , while I admonish you! O Israel, if you would but listen to me!
@1287 There shall be no strange god among you; you shall not bow down to a foreign god.
@1288 I am the Lord your God, who brought you up out of the land of Egypt. Open your mouth wide , and I will fill it.
@1289 But my people did not listen to my voice; Israel would not submit to me.
@1290 So I gave them over to their stubborn hearts, to follow their own counsels.
@1291 Oh , that my people would listen to me, that Israel would walk in my ways!
@1292 I would soon subdue their enemies and turn my hand against their foes.
@1293 Those who hate the Lord would cringe toward him, and their fate would last forever.
@1294 But he would feed you with the finest of the wheat, and with honey from the rock I would satisfy you.

@1298 Rescue the weak and the needy; deliver them from the hand of the wicked.
@1299 They have neither knowledge nor understanding, they walk about in darkness; all the foundations of the earth are shaken.
@1300 I said, You are gods, sons of the Most High, all of you;

@1304 For behold , your enemies make an uproar; those who hate you have raised their heads.
@1305 They lay crafty plans against your people; they consult together against your treasured ones.
@1306 They say, Come, let us wipe them out as a nation; let the name of Israel be remembered no more!
@1307 For they conspire with one accord; against you they make a covenant —
@1308 the tents of Edom and the Ishmaelites, Moab and the Hagrites,
@1309 Gebal and Ammon and Amalek, Philistia with the inhabitants of Tyre;
@1310 Asshur also has joined them; they are the strong arm of the children of Lot. Selah

@1316 As fire consumes the forest, as the flame sets the mountains ablaze,
@1317 so may you pursue them with your tempest and terrify them with your hurricane!
@1318 Fill their faces with shame, that they may seek your name , O Lord.

@1379 Do you work wonders for the dead? Do the departed rise up to praise you? Selah

@1418 if they violate my statutes and do not keep my commandments,
@1419 then I will punish their transgression with the rod and their iniquity with stripes,
@1420 but I will not remove from him my steadfast love or be false to my faithfulness.
@1421 I will not violate my covenant or alter the word that went forth from my lips.
@1422 Once for all I have sworn by my holiness; I will not lie to David.
@1423 His offspring shall endure forever, his throne as long as the sun before me.
@1424 Like the moon it shall be established forever, a faithful witness in the skies. Selah
@1425 But now you have cast off and rejected; you are full of wrath against your anointed.
@1426 You have renounced the covenant with your servant; you have defiled his crown in the dust.
@1427 You have breached all his walls; you have laid his strongholds in ruins.
@1428 All who pass by plunder him; he has the scorn of his neighbors.
@1429 You have exalted the right hand of his foes; you have made all his enemies rejoice.
@1430 You have also turned back the edge of his sword, and you have not made him stand in battle.
@1431 You have made his splendor to cease and cast his throne to the ground.
@1432 You have cut short the days of his youth; you have covered him with shame. Selah
@1433 How long, O Lord ? Will you hide yourself forever? How long will your wrath burn like fire?
@1434 Remember how short my time is! For what vanity you have created all the children of man!
@1435 What man can live and never see death? Who can deliver his soul from the power of Sheol? Selah
@1436 Lord, where is your steadfast love of old, which by your faithfulness you swore to David?
@1437 Remember , O Lord , how your servants are mocked, and how I bear in my heart the insults of all the many nations,
@1438 with which your enemies mock , O Lord, with which they mock the footsteps of your anointed.
@1439 Blessed be the Lord forever! Amen and Amen. Book Four

@1440 From Everlasting to Everlasting A Prayer of Moses , the man of God. Lord , you have been our dwelling place in all generations.
@1441 Before the mountains were brought forth, or ever you had formed the earth and the world, from everlasting to everlasting you are God.
@1442 You return man to dust and say, Return, O children of man!
@1443 For a thousand years in your sight are but as yesterday when it is past, or as a watch in the night.
@1444 You sweep them away as with a flood ; they are like a dream, like grass that is renewed in the morning:
@1445 in the morning it flourishes and is renewed; in the evening it fades and withers.
@1446 For we are brought to an end by your anger; by your wrath we are dismayed.
@1447 You have set our iniquities before you, our secret sins in the light of your presence.
@1448 For all our days pass away under your wrath; we bring our years to an end like a sigh.
@1449 The years of our life are seventy, or even by reason of strength eighty; yet their span is but toil and trouble; they are soon gone , and we fly away.
@1450 Who considers the power of your anger, and your wrath according to the fear of you?
@1451 So teach us to number our days that we may get a heart of wisdom.
@1452 Return , O Lord! How long? Have pity on your servants!
@1453 Satisfy us in the morning with your steadfast love, that we may rejoice and be glad all our days.
@1454 Make us glad for as many days as you have afflicted us, and for as many years as we have seen evil.
@1455 Let your work be shown to your servants, and your glorious power to their children.
@1456 Let the favor of the Lord our God be upon us, and establish the work of our hands upon us; yes, establish the work of our hands!

# 91
@1457 My Refuge and My Fortress He who dwells in the shelter of the Most High will abide in the shadow of the Almighty.
@1458 I will say to the Lord, My refuge and my fortress, my God , in whom I trust.
@1459 For he will deliver you from the snare of the fowler and from the deadly pestilence.
@1460 He will cover you with his pinions, and under his wings you will find refuge; his faithfulness is a shield and buckler.
@1461 You will not fear the terror of the night, nor the arrow that flies by day,
@1462 nor the pestilence that stalks in darkness, nor the destruction that wastes at noonday.
@1463 A thousand may fall at your side, ten thousand at your right hand, but it will not come near you.
@1464 You will only look with your eyes and see the recompense of the wicked.
@1465 Because you have made the Lord your dwelling place — the Most High , who is my refuge —
@1466 no evil shall be allowed to befall you, no plague come near your tent.
@1467 For he will command his angels concerning you to guard you in all your ways.
@1468 On their hands they will bear you up, lest you strike your foot against a stone.
@1469 You will tread on the lion and the adder; the young lion and the serpent you will trample underfoot.
@1470 Because he holds fast to me in love , I will deliver him; I will protect him, because he knows my name.
@1471 When he calls to me, I will answer him; I will be with him in trouble; I will rescue him and honor him.
@1472 With long life I will satisfy him and show him my salvation.

@1473 How Great Are Your Works A Psalm . A Song for the Sabbath. It is good to give thanks to the Lord, to sing praises to your name, O Most High;
@1474 to declare your steadfast love in the morning, and your faithfulness by night,
@1475 to the music of the lute the harp, to the melody of the lyre.
@1476 For you, O Lord , have made me glad by your work; at the works of your hands I sing for joy.
@1477 How great are your works , O Lord! Your thoughts are very deep!
@1478 The stupid man cannot know; the fool cannot understand this:
@1479 that though the wicked sprout like grass and all evildoers flourish, they are doomed to destruction forever;
@1480 but you, O Lord , are on high forever.
@1481 For behold , your enemies , O Lord, for behold , your enemies shall perish; all evildoers shall be scattered.
@1482 But you have exalted my horn like that of the wild ox; you have poured over me fresh oil.
@1483 My eyes have seen the downfall of my enemies; my ears have heard the doom of my evil assailants.
@1484 The righteous flourish like the palm tree and grow like a cedar in Lebanon.
@1485 They are planted in the house of the Lord; they flourish in the courts of our God.
@1486 They still bear fruit in old age; they are ever full of sap and green,
@1487 to declare that the Lord is upright; he is my rock , and there is no unrighteousness in him.

# 93
@1488 The Lord Reigns The Lord reigns ; he is robed in majesty; the Lord is robed ; he has put on strength as his belt. Yes , the world is established; it shall never be moved.
@1489 Your throne is established from of old; you are from everlasting.
@1490 The floods have lifted up , O Lord, the floods have lifted up their voice; the floods lift up their roaring.
@1491 Mightier than the thunders of many waters, mightier than the waves of the sea, the Lord on high is mighty!
@1492 Your decrees are very trustworthy; holiness befits your house, O Lord, forevermore.

# 94
@1493 The Lord Will Not Forsake His People O Lord, God of vengeance, O God of vengeance, shine forth!
@1494 Rise up , O judge of the earth; repay to the proud what they deserve!
@1495 O Lord, how long shall the wicked, how long shall the wicked exult?
@1496 They pour out their arrogant words; all the evildoers boast.
@1497 They crush your people , O Lord, and afflict your heritage.
@1498 They kill the widow and the sojourner, and murder the fatherless;
@1499 and they say, The Lord does not see; the God of Jacob does not perceive.
@1500 Understand , O dullest of the people! Fools, when will you be wise?
@1501 He who planted the ear , does he not hear? He who formed the eye , does he not see?
@1502 He who disciplines the nations , does he not rebuke? He who teaches man knowledge —
@1503 the Lord — knows the thoughts of man, that they are but a breath.
@1504 Blessed is the man whom you discipline , O Lord, and whom you teach out of your law,
@1505 to give him rest from days of trouble, until a pit is dug for the wicked.
@1506 For the Lord will not forsake his people; he will not abandon his heritage;
@1507 for justice will return to the righteous, and all the upright in heart will follow it.
@1508 Who rises up for me against the wicked? Who stands up for me against evildoers?
@1509 If the Lord had not been my help, my soul would soon have lived in the land of silence.
@1510 When I thought, My foot slips, your steadfast love , O Lord, held me up.
@1511 When the cares of my heart are many, your consolations cheer my soul.
@1512 Can wicked rulers be allied with you, those who frame injustice by statute?
@1513 They band together against the life of the righteous and condemn the innocent to death.
@1514 But the Lord has become my stronghold, and my God the rock of my refuge.
@1515 He will bring back on them their iniquity and wipe them out for their wickedness; the Lord our God will wipe them out.

@1516 Let Us Sing Songs of Praise Oh come , let us sing to the Lord; let us make a joyful noise to the rock of our salvation!
@1517 Let us come into his presence with thanksgiving; let us make a joyful noise to him with songs of praise!
@1518 For the Lord is a great God, and a great King above all gods.
@1519 In his hand are the depths of the earth; the heights of the mountains are his also.
@1520 The sea is his , for he made it, and his hands formed the dry land.
@1521 Oh come , let us worship and bow down; let us kneel before the Lord , our Maker!
@1522 For he is our God, and we are the people of his pasture, and the sheep of his hand. Today, if you hear his voice,
@1523 do not harden your hearts , as at Meribah, as on the day at Massah in the wilderness,
@1524 when your fathers put me to the test and put me to the proof, though they had seen my work.
@1525 For forty years I loathed that generation and said, They are a people who go astray in their heart, and they have not known my ways.
@1526 Therefore I swore in my wrath, They shall not enter my rest.

@1530 For great is the Lord , and greatly to be praised; he is to be feared above all gods.
@1531 For all the gods of the peoples are worthless idols, but the Lord made the heavens.
@1532 Splendor and majesty are before him; strength and beauty are in his sanctuary.
@1533 Ascribe to the Lord , O families of the peoples, ascribe to the Lord glory and strength!
@1534 Ascribe to the Lord the glory due his name; bring an offering , and come into his courts!
@1535 Worship the Lord in the splendor of holiness; tremble before him, all the earth!
@1536 Say among the nations, The Lord reigns! Yes , the world is established ; it shall never be moved; he will judge the peoples with equity.
@1537 Let the heavens be glad , and let the earth rejoice; let the sea roar , and all that fills it;
@1538 let the field exult , and everything in it! Then shall all the trees of the forest sing for joy
@1539 before the Lord, for he comes, for he comes to judge the earth. He will judge the world in righteousness, and the peoples in his faithfulness.

@1544 The mountains melt like wax before the Lord, before the Lord of all the earth.
@1545 The heavens proclaim his righteousness, and all the peoples see his glory.
@1546 All worshipers of images are put to shame, who make their boast in worthless idols; worship him, all you gods!
@1547 Zion hears and is glad, and the daughters of Judah rejoice, because of your judgments , O Lord.
@1548 For you, O Lord , are most high over all the earth; you are exalted far above all gods.
@1549 O you who love the Lord, hate evil! He preserves the lives of his saints; he delivers them from the hand of the wicked.

@1553 The Lord has made known his salvation; he has revealed his righteousness in the sight of the nations.
@1554 He has remembered his steadfast love and faithfulness to the house of Israel. All the ends of the earth have seen the salvation of our God.
@1555 Make a joyful noise to the Lord, all the earth; break forth into joyous song and sing praises!
@1556 Sing praises to the Lord with the lyre, with the lyre and the sound of melody!

@1566 Moses and Aaron were among his priests, Samuel also was among those who called upon his name. They called to the Lord , and he answered them.
@1567 In the pillar of the cloud he spoke to them; they kept his testimonies and the statute that he gave them.
@1568 O Lord our God , you answered them; you were a forgiving God to them, but an avenger of their wrongdoings.
@1569 Exalt the Lord our God, and worship at his holy mountain; for the Lord our God is holy!

@1575 I Will Walk with Integrity A Psalm of David. I will sing of steadfast love and justice; to you, O Lord , I will make music.
@1576 I will ponder the way that is blameless. Oh when will you come to me? I will walk with integrity of heart within my house;
@1577 I will not set before my eyes anything that is worthless. I hate the work of those who fall away; it shall not cling to me.
@1578 A perverse heart shall be far from me; I will know nothing of evil.
@1579 Whoever slanders his neighbor secretly I will destroy. Whoever has a haughty look and an arrogant heart I will not endure.
@1580 I will look with favor on the faithful in the land, that they may dwell with me; he who walks in the way that is blameless shall minister to me.
@1581 No one who practices deceit shall dwell in my house; no one who utters lies shall continue before my eyes.
@1582 Morning by morning I will destroy all the wicked in the land, cutting off all the evildoers from the city of the Lord.

# 102
@1583 Do Not Hide Your Face from Me A Prayer of one afflicted, when he is faint and pours out his complaint before the Lord. Hear my prayer , O Lord; let my cry come to you!
@1584 Do not hide your face from me in the day of my distress! Incline your ear to me; answer me speedily in the day when I call!
@1585 For my days pass away like smoke, and my bones burn like a furnace.
@1586 My heart is struck down like grass and has withered; I forget to eat my bread.
@1587 Because of my loud groaning my bones cling to my flesh.
@1588 I am like a desert owl of the wilderness, like an owl of the waste places;
@1589 I lie awake; I am like a lonely sparrow on the housetop.
@1590 All the day my enemies taunt me; those who deride me use my name for a curse.
@1591 For I eat ashes like bread and mingle tears with my drink,
@1592 because of your indignation and anger; for you have taken me up and thrown me down.
@1593 My days are like an evening shadow; I wither away like grass.
@1594 But you, O Lord , are enthroned forever; you are remembered throughout all generations.
@1595 You will arise and have pity on Zion; it is the time to favor her; the appointed time has come.
@1596 For your servants hold her stones dear and have pity on her dust.
@1597 Nations will fear the name of the Lord, and all the kings of the earth will fear your glory.
@1598 For the Lord builds up Zion; he appears in his glory;
@1599 he regards the prayer of the destitute and does not despise their prayer.
@1600 Let this be recorded for a generation to come, so that a people yet to be created may praise the Lord:
@1601 that he looked down from his holy height; from heaven the Lord looked at the earth,
@1602 to hear the groans of the prisoners, to set free those who were doomed to die,
@1603 that they may declare in Zion the name of the Lord, and in Jerusalem his praise,
@1604 when peoples gather together, and kingdoms , to worship the Lord.
@1605 He has broken my strength in midcourse; he has shortened my days.
@1606 O my God, I say, take me not away in the midst of my days — you whose years endure throughout all generations!
@1607 Of old you laid the foundation of the earth, and the heavens are the work of your hands.
@1608 They will perish , but you will remain; they will all wear out like a garment. You will change them like a robe , and they will pass away,
@1609 but you are the same, and your years have no end.
@1610 The children of your servants shall dwell secure; their offspring shall be established before you.

@1611 Bless the Lord , O My Soul Of David. Bless the Lord , O my soul, and all that is within me, bless his holy name!

@1613 who forgives all your iniquity, who heals all your diseases,
@1614 who redeems your life from the pit, who crowns you with steadfast love and mercy,
@1615 who satisfies you with good so that your youth is renewed like the eagle’s.
@1616 The Lord works righteousness and justice for all who are oppressed.
@1617 He made known his ways to Moses, his acts to the people of Israel.
@1618 The Lord is merciful and gracious, slow to anger and abounding in steadfast love.
@1619 He will not always chide, nor will he keep his anger forever.
@1620 He does not deal with us according to our sins, nor repay us according to our iniquities.
@1621 For as high as the heavens are above the earth, so great is his steadfast love toward those who fear him;
@1622 as far as the east is from the west, so far does he remove our transgressions from us.
@1623 As a father shows compassion to his children, so the Lord shows compassion to those who fear him.
@1624 For he knows our frame; he remembers that we are dust.
@1625 As for man , his days are like grass; he flourishes like a flower of the field;
@1626 for the wind passes over it, and it is gone, and its place knows it no more.
@1627 But the steadfast love of the Lord is from everlasting to everlasting on those who fear him, and his righteousness to children’s children,
@1628 to those who keep his covenant and remember to do his commandments.
@1629 The Lord has established his throne in the heavens, and his kingdom rules over all.
@1630 Bless the Lord , O you his angels, you mighty ones who do his word, obeying the voice of his word!

@1634 covering yourself with light as with a garment, stretching out the heavens like a tent.
@1635 He lays the beams of his chambers on the waters; he makes the clouds his chariot; he rides on the wings of the wind;
@1636 he makes his messengers winds, his ministers a flaming fire.
@1637 He set the earth on its foundations, so that it should never be moved.
@1638 You covered it with the deep as with a garment; the waters stood above the mountains.
@1639 At your rebuke they fled; at the sound of your thunder they took to flight.
@1640 The mountains rose , the valleys sank down to the place that you appointed for them.
@1641 You set a boundary that they may not pass, so that they might not again cover the earth.
@1642 You make springs gush forth in the valleys; they flow between the hills;
@1643 they give drink to every beast of the field; the wild donkeys quench their thirst.
@1644 Beside them the birds of the heavens dwell; they sing among the branches.
@1645 From your lofty abode you water the mountains; the earth is satisfied with the fruit of your work.
@1646 You cause the grass to grow for the livestock and plants for man to cultivate, that he may bring forth food from the earth
@1647 and wine to gladden the heart of man, oil to make his face shine and bread to strengthen man’s heart.
@1648 The trees of the Lord are watered abundantly, the cedars of Lebanon that he planted.
@1649 In them the birds build their nests; the stork has her home in the fir trees.
@1650 The high mountains are for the wild goats; the rocks are a refuge for the rock badgers.
@1651 He made the moon to mark the seasons; the sun knows its time for setting.
@1652 You make darkness , and it is night, when all the beasts of the forest creep about.
@1653 The young lions roar for their prey, seeking their food from God.
@1654 When the sun rises , they steal away and lie down in their dens.
@1655 Man goes out to his work and to his labor until the evening.
@1656 O Lord, how manifold are your works! In wisdom have you made them all; the earth is full of your creatures.
@1657 Here is the sea, great and wide, which teems with creatures innumerable, living things both small and great.
@1658 There go the ships, and Leviathan, which you formed to play in it.
@1659 These all look to you, to give them their food in due season.
@1660 When you give it to them, they gather it up; when you open your hand , they are filled with good things.
@1661 When you hide your face , they are dismayed; when you take away their breath , they die and return to their dust.
@1662 When you send forth your Spirit, they are created, and you renew the face of the ground.
@1663 May the glory of the Lord endure forever; may the Lord rejoice in his works,
@1664 who looks on the earth and it trembles, who touches the mountains and they smoke!
@1665 I will sing to the Lord as long as I live; I will sing praise to my God while I have being.
@1666 May my meditation be pleasing to him, for I rejoice in the Lord.

@1671 Seek the Lord and his strength; seek his presence continually!
@1672 Remember the wondrous works that he has done, his miracles , and the judgments he uttered,
@1673 O offspring of Abraham , his servant, children of Jacob , his chosen ones!
@1674 He is the Lord our God; his judgments are in all the earth.
@1675 He remembers his covenant forever, the word that he commanded , for a thousand generations,
@1676 the covenant that he made with Abraham, his sworn promise to Isaac,
@1677 which he confirmed to Jacob as a statute, to Israel as an everlasting covenant,
@1678 saying, To you I will give the land of Canaan as your portion for an inheritance.
@1679 When they were few in number, of little account , and sojourners in it,
@1680 wandering from nation to nation, from one kingdom to another people,
@1681 he allowed no one to oppress them; he rebuked kings on their account,
@1682 saying, Touch not my anointed ones, do my prophets no harm!
@1683 When he summoned a famine on the land and broke all supply of bread,
@1684 he had sent a man ahead of them, Joseph , who was sold as a slave.
@1685 His feet were hurt with fetters; his neck was put in a collar of iron;
@1686 until what he had said came to pass, the word of the Lord tested him.
@1687 The king sent and released him; the ruler of the peoples set him free;
@1688 he made him lord of his house and ruler of all his possessions,
@1689 to bind his princes at his pleasure and to teach his elders wisdom.
@1690 Then Israel came to Egypt; Jacob sojourned in the land of Ham.
@1691 And the Lord made his people very fruitful and made them stronger than their foes.
@1692 He turned their hearts to hate his people, to deal craftily with his servants.
@1693 He sent Moses , his servant, and Aaron, whom he had chosen.
@1694 They performed his signs among them and miracles in the land of Ham.
@1695 He sent darkness , and made the land dark; they did not rebel against his words.
@1696 He turned their waters into blood and caused their fish to die.
@1697 Their land swarmed with frogs, even in the chambers of their kings.
@1698 He spoke , and there came swarms of flies, and gnats throughout their country.
@1699 He gave them hail for rain, and fiery lightning bolts through their land.
@1700 He struck down their vines and fig trees, and shattered the trees of their country.
@1701 He spoke , and the locusts came, young locusts without number,
@1702 which devoured all the vegetation in their land and ate up the fruit of their ground.
@1703 He struck down all the firstborn in their land, the firstfruits of all their strength.
@1704 Then he brought out Israel with silver and gold, and there was none among his tribes who stumbled.
@1705 Egypt was glad when they departed, for dread of them had fallen upon it.
@1706 He spread a cloud for a covering, and fire to give light by night.
@1707 They asked , and he brought quail, and gave them bread from heaven in abundance.
@1708 He opened the rock , and water gushed out; it flowed through the desert like a river.
@1709 For he remembered his holy promise, and Abraham , his servant.
@1710 So he brought his people out with joy, his chosen ones with singing.
@1711 And he gave them the lands of the nations, and they took possession of the fruit of the peoples ’ toil,
@1712 that they might keep his statutes and observe his laws. Praise the Lord!

@1717 that I may look upon the prosperity of your chosen ones, that I may rejoice in the gladness of your nation, that I may glory with your inheritance.
@1718 Both we and our fathers have sinned; we have committed iniquity ; we have done wickedness.
@1719 Our fathers , when they were in Egypt, did not consider your wondrous works; they did not remember the abundance of your steadfast love, but rebelled by the sea , at the Red Sea.
@1720 Yet he saved them for his name’s sake, that he might make known his mighty power.
@1721 He rebuked the Red Sea , and it became dry, and he led them through the deep as through a desert.
@1722 So he saved them from the hand of the foe and redeemed them from the power of the enemy.
@1723 And the waters covered their adversaries; not one of them was left.
@1724 Then they believed his words; they sang his praise.
@1725 But they soon forgot his works; they did not wait for his counsel.
@1726 But they had a wanton craving in the wilderness, and put God to the test in the desert;
@1727 he gave them what they asked, but sent a wasting disease among them.
@1728 When men in the camp were jealous of Moses and Aaron, the holy one of the Lord,
@1729 the earth opened and swallowed up Dathan, and covered the company of Abiram.
@1730 Fire also broke out in their company; the flame burned up the wicked.
@1731 They made a calf in Horeb and worshiped a metal image.
@1732 They exchanged the glory of God for the image of an ox that eats grass.
@1733 They forgot God , their Savior, who had done great things in Egypt,
@1734 wondrous works in the land of Ham, and awesome deeds by the Red Sea.
@1735 Therefore he said he would destroy them— had not Moses , his chosen one, stood in the breach before him, to turn away his wrath from destroying them.
@1736 Then they despised the pleasant land, having no faith in his promise.
@1737 They murmured in their tents, and did not obey the voice of the Lord.
@1738 Therefore he raised his hand and swore to them that he would make them fall in the wilderness,
@1739 and would make their offspring fall among the nations, scattering them among the lands.
@1740 Then they yoked themselves to the Baal of Peor, and ate sacrifices offered to the dead;
@1741 they provoked the Lord to anger with their deeds, and a plague broke out among them.
@1742 Then Phinehas stood up and intervened, and the plague was stayed.
@1743 And that was counted to him as righteousness from generation to generation forever.
@1744 They angered him at the waters of Meribah, and it went ill with Moses on their account,
@1745 for they made his spirit bitter, and he spoke rashly with his lips.
@1746 They did not destroy the peoples, as the Lord commanded them,
@1747 but they mixed with the nations and learned to do as they did.
@1748 They served their idols, which became a snare to them.
@1749 They sacrificed their sons and their daughters to the demons;
@1750 they poured out innocent blood, the blood of their sons and daughters, whom they sacrificed to the idols of Canaan, and the land was polluted with blood.
@1751 Thus they became unclean by their acts, and played the whore in their deeds.
@1752 Then the anger of the Lord was kindled against his people, and he abhorred his heritage;
@1753 he gave them into the hand of the nations, so that those who hated them ruled over them.
@1754 Their enemies oppressed them, and they were brought into subjection under their power.
@1755 Many times he delivered them, but they were rebellious in their purposes and were brought low through their iniquity.
@1756 Nevertheless, he looked upon their distress, when he heard their cry.
@1757 For their sake he remembered his covenant, and relented according to the abundance of his steadfast love.
@1758 He caused them to be pitied by all those who held them captive.
@1759 Save us, O Lord our God, and gather us from among the nations, that we may give thanks to your holy name and glory in your praise.
@1760 Blessed be the Lord , the God of Israel, from everlasting to everlasting! And let all the people say, Amen! Praise the Lord! Book Five

@1761 Let the Redeemed of the Lord Say So Oh give thanks to the Lord, for he is good, for his steadfast love endures forever!
@1762 Let the redeemed of the Lord say so, whom he has redeemed from trouble
@1763 and gathered in from the lands, from the east and from the west, from the north and from the south.
@1764 Some wandered in desert wastes, finding no way to a city to dwell in;
@1765 hungry and thirsty, their soul fainted within them.
@1766 Then they cried to the Lord in their trouble, and he delivered them from their distress.
@1767 He led them by a straight way till they reached a city to dwell in.
@1768 Let them thank the Lord for his steadfast love, for his wondrous works to the children of man!
@1769 For he satisfies the longing soul, and the hungry soul he fills with good things.
@1770 Some sat in darkness and in the shadow of death, prisoners in affliction and in irons,
@1771 for they had rebelled against the words of God, and spurned the counsel of the Most High.
@1772 So he bowed their hearts down with hard labor; they fell down, with none to help.
@1773 Then they cried to the Lord in their trouble, and he delivered them from their distress.
@1774 He brought them out of darkness and the shadow of death, and burst their bonds apart.
@1775 Let them thank the Lord for his steadfast love, for his wondrous works to the children of man!
@1776 For he shatters the doors of bronze and cuts in two the bars of iron.
@1777 Some were fools through their sinful ways, and because of their iniquities suffered affliction;
@1778 they loathed any kind of food, and they drew near to the gates of death.
@1779 Then they cried to the Lord in their trouble, and he delivered them from their distress.
@1780 He sent out his word and healed them, and delivered them from their destruction.
@1781 Let them thank the Lord for his steadfast love, for his wondrous works to the children of man!
@1782 And let them offer sacrifices of thanksgiving, and tell of his deeds in songs of joy!
@1783 Some went down to the sea in ships, doing business on the great waters;
@1784 they saw the deeds of the Lord, his wondrous works in the deep.
@1785 For he commanded and raised the stormy wind, which lifted up the waves of the sea.
@1786 They mounted up to heaven ; they went down to the depths; their courage melted away in their evil plight;
@1787 they reeled and staggered like drunken men and were at their wits ’ end.
@1788 Then they cried to the Lord in their trouble, and he delivered them from their distress.
@1789 He made the storm be still, and the waves of the sea were hushed.
@1790 Then they were glad that the waters were quiet, and he brought them to their desired haven.
@1791 Let them thank the Lord for his steadfast love, for his wondrous works to the children of man!
@1792 Let them extol him in the congregation of the people, and praise him in the assembly of the elders.
@1793 He turns rivers into a desert, springs of water into thirsty ground,
@1794 a fruitful land into a salty waste, because of the evil of its inhabitants.
@1795 He turns a desert into pools of water, a parched land into springs of water.
@1796 And there he lets the hungry dwell, and they establish a city to live in;
@1797 they sow fields and plant vineyards and get a fruitful yield.
@1798 By his blessing they multiply greatly, and he does not let their livestock diminish.
@1799 When they are diminished and brought low through oppression, evil , and sorrow,
@1800 he pours contempt on princes and makes them wander in trackless wastes;
@1801 but he raises up the needy out of affliction and makes their families like flocks.
@1802 The upright see it and are glad, and all wickedness shuts its mouth.
@1803 Whoever is wise , let him attend to these things; let them consider the steadfast love of the Lord.

@1806 I will give thanks to you, O Lord , among the peoples; I will sing praises to you among the nations.

@1808 Be exalted , O God, above the heavens! Let your glory be over all the earth!
@1809 That your beloved ones may be delivered, give salvation by your right hand and answer me!
@1810 God has promised in his holiness: With exultation I will divide up Shechem and portion out the Valley of Succoth.
@1811 Gilead is mine; Manasseh is mine; Ephraim is my helmet, Judah my scepter.
@1812 Moab is my washbasin; upon Edom I cast my shoe; over Philistia I shout in triumph.
@1813 Who will bring me to the fortified city? Who will lead me to Edom?

@1817 Help Me, O Lord My God To the choirmaster . A Psalm of David. Be not silent , O God of my praise!
@1818 For wicked and deceitful mouths are opened against me, speaking against me with lying tongues.
@1819 They encircle me with words of hate, and attack me without cause.
@1820 In return for my love they accuse me, but I give myself to prayer.
@1821 So they reward me evil for good, and hatred for my love.
@1822 Appoint a wicked man against him; let an accuser stand at his right hand.
@1823 When he is tried , let him come forth guilty; let his prayer be counted as sin!
@1824 May his days be few; may another take his office!
@1825 May his children be fatherless and his wife a widow!
@1826 May his children wander about and beg, seeking food far from the ruins they inhabit!
@1827 May the creditor seize all that he has; may strangers plunder the fruits of his toil!
@1828 Let there be none to extend kindness to him, nor any to pity his fatherless children!
@1829 May his posterity be cut off; may his name be blotted out in the second generation!
@1830 May the iniquity of his fathers be remembered before the Lord, and let not the sin of his mother be blotted out!
@1831 Let them be before the Lord continually, that he may cut off the memory of them from the earth!
@1832 For he did not remember to show kindness, but pursued the poor and needy and the brokenhearted , to put them to death.
@1833 He loved to curse ; let curses come upon him! He did not delight in blessing ; may it be far from him!
@1834 He clothed himself with cursing as his coat; may it soak into his body like water, like oil into his bones!
@1835 May it be like a garment that he wraps around him, like a belt that he puts on every day!
@1836 May this be the reward of my accusers from the Lord, of those who speak evil against my life!
@1837 But you, O God my Lord, deal on my behalf for your name’s sake; because your steadfast love is good, deliver me!
@1838 For I am poor and needy, and my heart is stricken within me.
@1839 I am gone like a shadow at evening; I am shaken off like a locust.
@1840 My knees are weak through fasting; my body has become gaunt , with no fat.
@1841 I am an object of scorn to my accusers; when they see me, they wag their heads.
@1842 Help me, O Lord my God! Save me according to your steadfast love!
@1843 Let them know that this is your hand; you, O Lord , have done it!
@1844 Let them curse , but you will bless! They arise and are put to shame , but your servant will be glad!
@1845 May my accusers be clothed with dishonor; may they be wrapped in their own shame as in a cloak!
@1846 With my mouth I will give great thanks to the Lord; I will praise him in the midst of the throng.
@1847 For he stands at the right hand of the needy one, to save him from those who condemn his soul to death.

@2345 But my eyes are toward you, O God , my Lord; in you I seek refuge; leave me not defenseless!
@2346 Keep me from the trap that they have laid for me and from the snares of evildoers!
@2347 Let the wicked fall into their own nets, while I pass by safely.

@2348 You Are My Refuge A Maskil of David , when he was in the cave . A Prayer. With my voice I cry out to the Lord; with my voice I plead for mercy to the Lord.
@2349 I pour out my complaint before him; I tell my trouble before him.
@2350 When my spirit faints within me, you know my way! In the path where I walk they have hidden a trap for me.
@2351 Look to the right and see: there is none who takes notice of me; no refuge remains to me; no one cares for my soul.
@2352 I cry to you , O Lord; I say, You are my refuge, my portion in the land of the living.
@2353 Attend to my cry, for I am brought very low! Deliver me from my persecutors, for they are too strong for me!
@2354 Bring me out of prison, that I may give thanks to your name! The righteous will surround me, for you will deal bountifully with me.

@2355 My Soul Thirsts for You A Psalm of David. Hear my prayer , O Lord; give ear to my pleas for mercy! In your faithfulness answer me, in your righteousness!
@2356 Enter not into judgment with your servant, for no one living is righteous before you.
@2357 For the enemy has pursued my soul; he has crushed my life to the ground; he has made me sit in darkness like those long dead.
@2358 Therefore my spirit faints within me; my heart within me is appalled.
@2359 I remember the days of old; I meditate on all that you have done; I ponder the work of your hands.
@2360 I stretch out my hands to you; my soul thirsts for you like a parched land. Selah
@2361 Answer me quickly , O Lord! My spirit fails! Hide not your face from me, lest I be like those who go down to the pit.
@2362 Let me hear in the morning of your steadfast love, for in you I trust. Make me know the way I should go, for to you I lift up my soul.
@2363 Deliver me from my enemies , O Lord! I have fled to you for refuge.
@2364 Teach me to do your will, for you are my God! Let your good Spirit lead me on level ground!
@2365 For your name’s sake , O Lord, preserve my life! In your righteousness bring my soul out of trouble!
@2366 And in your steadfast love you will cut off my enemies, and you will destroy all the adversaries of my soul, for I am your servant.

@2367 My Rock and My Fortress Of David. Blessed be the Lord , my rock, who trains my hands for war, and my fingers for battle;
@2368 he is my steadfast love and my fortress, my stronghold and my deliverer, my shield and he in whom I take refuge, who subdues peoples under me.
@2369 O Lord, what is man that you regard him, or the son of man that you think of him?
@2370 Man is like a breath; his days are like a passing shadow.
@2371 Bow your heavens , O Lord , and come down! Touch the mountains so that they smoke!
@2372 Flash forth the lightning and scatter them; send out your arrows and rout them!
@2373 Stretch out your hand from on high; rescue me and deliver me from the many waters, from the hand of foreigners,
@2374 whose mouths speak lies and whose right hand is a right hand of falsehood.
@2375 I will sing a new song to you, O God; upon a ten-stringed harp I will play to you,
@2376 who gives victory to kings, who rescues David his servant from the cruel sword.
@2377 Rescue me and deliver me from the hand of foreigners, whose mouths speak lies and whose right hand is a right hand of falsehood.
@2378 May our sons in their youth be like plants full grown, our daughters like corner pillars cut for the structure of a palace;
@2379 may our granaries be full, providing all kinds of produce; may our sheep bring forth thousands and ten thousands in our fields;
@2380 may our cattle be heavy with young, suffering no mishap or failure in bearing; may there be no cry of distress in our streets!
@2381 Blessed are the people to whom such blessings fall! Blessed are the people whose God is the Lord!
