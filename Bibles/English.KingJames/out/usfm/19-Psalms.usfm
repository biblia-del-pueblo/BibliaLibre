\v 1 Blessed is the man that walketh not in the counsel of the ungodly, nor standeth in the way of sinners, nor sitteth in the seat of the scornful.\f + \fr 1:1 \ft ungodly: or, wicked \f* 
\v 2 But his delight is in the law of the \sc [Lord\sc*]{.smallcaps}; and in his law doth he meditate day and night. 
\v 3 And he shall be like a tree planted by the rivers of water, that bringeth forth his fruit in his season; his leaf also shall not wither; and whatsoever he doeth shall prosper.\f + \fr 1:3 \ft wither: Heb. fade \f* 
\v 4 The ungodly are not so: but are like the chaff which the wind driveth away.

\v 2 The kings of the earth set themselves, and the rulers take counsel together, against the \sc [Lord\sc*]{.smallcaps}, and against his anointed, saying,

\v 8 Ask of me, and I shall give thee the heathen for thine inheritance, and the uttermost parts of the earth for thy possession. 
\v 9 Thou shalt break them with a rod of iron; thou shalt dash them in pieces like a potter’s vessel. 
\v 10 Be wise now therefore, O ye kings: be instructed, ye judges of the earth. 
\v 11 Serve the \sc [Lord\sc*]{.smallcaps} with fear, and rejoice with trembling. 
\v 12 Kiss the Son, lest he be angry, and ye perish from the way, when his wrath is kindled but a little. Blessed are all they that put their trust in him.

\v 6 In my distress I called upon the \sc [Lord\sc*]{.smallcaps}, and cried unto my God: he heard my voice out of his temple, and my cry came before him, even into his ears. 
\v 7 Then the earth shook and trembled; the foundations also of the hills moved and were shaken, because he was wroth. 
\v 8 There went up a smoke out of his nostrils, and fire out of his mouth devoured: coals were kindled by it.\f + \fr 18:8 \ft out of his nostrils: Heb. by his, etc \f* 
\v 9 He bowed the heavens also, and came down: and darkness was under his feet. 
\v 10 And he rode upon a cherub, and did fly: yea, he did fly upon the wings of the wind. 
\v 11 He made darkness his secret place; his pavilion round about him were dark waters and thick clouds of the skies. 
\v 12 At the brightness that was before him his thick clouds passed, hail stones and coals of fire. 
\v 13 The \sc [Lord\sc*]{.smallcaps} also thundered in the heavens, and the Highest gave his voice; hail stones and coals of fire.

\v 15 Then the channels of waters were seen, and the foundations of the world were discovered at thy rebuke, O \sc [Lord\sc*]{.smallcaps}, at the blast of the breath of thy nostrils. 
\v 16 He sent from above, he took me, he drew me out of many waters.\f + \fr 18:16 \ft many: or, great \f*

\v 19 He brought me forth also into a large place; he delivered me, because he delighted in me. 
\v 20 The \sc [Lord\sc*]{.smallcaps} rewarded me according to my righteousness; according to the cleanness of my hands hath he recompensed me. 
\v 21 For I have kept the ways of the \sc [Lord\sc*]{.smallcaps}, and have not wickedly departed from my God.

\v 33 He maketh my feet like hinds’ feet, and setteth me upon my high places. 
\v 34 He teacheth my hands to war, so that a bow of steel is broken by mine arms. 
\v 35 Thou hast also given me the shield of thy salvation: and thy right hand hath holden me up, and thy gentleness hath made me great.\f + \fr 18:35 \ft thy gentleness…: or, with thy meekness thou hast multiplied me \f* 
\v 36 Thou hast enlarged my steps under me, that my feet did not slip.\f + \fr 18:36 \ft my feet: Heb. mine ankles \f* 
\v 37 I have pursued mine enemies, and overtaken them: neither did I turn again till they were consumed. 
\v 38 I have wounded them that they were not able to rise: they are fallen under my feet. 
\v 39 For thou hast girded me with strength unto the battle: thou hast subdued under me those that rose up against me.\f + \fr 18:39 \ft subdued: Heb. caused to bow \f* 
\v 40 Thou hast also given me the necks of mine enemies; that I might destroy them that hate me. 
\v 41 They cried, but there was none to save them: even unto the \sc [Lord\sc*]{.smallcaps}, but he answered them not. 
\v 42 Then did I beat them small as the dust before the wind: I did cast them out as the dirt in the streets. 
\v 43 Thou hast delivered me from the strivings of the people; and thou hast made me the head of the heathen: a people whom I have not known shall serve me. 
\v 44 As soon as they hear of me, they shall obey me: the strangers shall submit themselves unto me.\f + \fr 18:44 \ft As soon…: Heb. At the hearing of the ear \f* \f + \fr 18:44 \ft submit…: or, yield feigned obedience \f* \f + \fr 18:44 \ft strangers: Heb. sons of the stranger \f*

\v 1 O God, why hast thou cast us off for ever? why doth thine anger smoke against the sheep of thy pasture?\f + \fr 74:1 \ft Maschil…: or, A Psalm for Asaph to give instruction \f* 
\v 2 Remember thy congregation, which thou hast purchased of old; the rod of thine inheritance, which thou hast redeemed; this mount Zion, wherein thou hast dwelt.\f + \fr 74:2 \ft rod: or, tribe \f* 
\v 3 Lift up thy feet unto the perpetual desolations; even all that the enemy hath done wickedly in the sanctuary. 
\v 4 Thine enemies roar in the midst of thy congregations; they set up their ensigns for signs. 
\v 5 A man was famous according as he had lifted up axes upon the thick trees. 
\v 6 But now they break down the carved work thereof at once with axes and hammers. 
\v 7 They have cast fire into thy sanctuary, they have defiled by casting down the dwelling place of thy name to the ground.\f + \fr 74:7 \ft They have cast…: Heb. They have sent thy sanctuary unto the fire \f* 
\v 8 They said in their hearts, Let us destroy them together: they have burned up all the synagogues of God in the land.\f + \fr 74:8 \ft destroy: Heb. break \f* 
\v 9 We see not our signs: there is no more any prophet: neither is there among us any that knoweth how long. 
\v 10 O God, how long shall the adversary reproach? shall the enemy blaspheme thy name for ever? 
\v 11 Why withdrawest thou thy hand, even thy right hand? pluck it out of thy bosom. 
\v 12 For God is my King of old, working salvation in the midst of the earth. 
\v 13 Thou didst divide the sea by thy strength: thou brakest the heads of the dragons in the waters.\f + \fr 74:13 \ft divide: Heb. break \f* \f + \fr 74:13 \ft dragons: or, whales \f* 
\v 14 Thou brakest the heads of leviathan in pieces, and gavest him to be meat to the people inhabiting the wilderness. 
\v 15 Thou didst cleave the fountain and the flood: thou driedst up mighty rivers.\f + \fr 74:15 \ft mighty…: Heb. rivers of strength \f* 
\v 16 The day is thine, the night also is thine: thou hast prepared the light and the sun. 
\v 17 Thou hast set all the borders of the earth: thou hast made summer and winter.\f + \fr 74:17 \ft made: Heb. made them \f* 
\v 18 Remember this, that the enemy hath reproached, O \sc [Lord\sc*]{.smallcaps}, and that the foolish people have blasphemed thy name. 
\v 19 O deliver not the soul of thy turtledove unto the multitude of the wicked: forget not the congregation of thy poor for ever. 
\v 20 Have respect unto the covenant: for the dark places of the earth are full of the habitations of cruelty. 
\v 21 O let not the oppressed return ashamed: let the poor and needy praise thy name. 
\v 22 Arise, O God, plead thine own cause: remember how the foolish man reproacheth thee daily. 
\v 23 Forget not the voice of thine enemies: the tumult of those that rise up against thee increaseth continually.\f + \fr 74:23 \ft increaseth: Heb. ascendeth \f*

\v 3 The earth and all the inhabitants thereof are dissolved: I bear up the pillars of it. Selah. 
\v 4 I said unto the fools, Deal not foolishly: and to the wicked, Lift not up the horn: 
\v 5 Lift not up your horn on high: speak not with a stiff neck. 
\v 6 For promotion cometh neither from the east, nor from the west, nor from the south.\f + \fr 75:6 \ft south: Heb. desert \f* 
\v 7 But God is the judge: he putteth down one, and setteth up another. 
\v 8 For in the hand of the \sc [Lord\sc*]{.smallcaps} there is a cup, and the wine is red; it is full of mixture; and he poureth out of the same: but the dregs thereof, all the wicked of the earth shall wring them out, and drink them. 
\v 9 But I will declare for ever; I will sing praises to the God of Jacob. 
\v 10 All the horns of the wicked also will I cut off; but the horns of the righteous shall be exalted.

\v 2 In Salem also is his tabernacle, and his dwelling place in Zion. 
\v 3 There brake he the arrows of the bow, the shield, and the sword, and the battle. Selah. 
\v 4 Thou art more glorious and excellent than the mountains of prey. 
\v 5 The stouthearted are spoiled, they have slept their sleep: and none of the men of might have found their hands. 
\v 6 At thy rebuke, O God of Jacob, both the chariot and horse are cast into a dead sleep. 
\v 7 Thou, even thou, art to be feared: and who may stand in thy sight when once thou art angry? 
\v 8 Thou didst cause judgment to be heard from heaven; the earth feared, and was still, 
\v 9 When God arose to judgment, to save all the meek of the earth. Selah. 
\v 10 Surely the wrath of man shall praise thee: the remainder of wrath shalt thou restrain. 
\v 11 Vow, and pay unto the \sc [Lord\sc*]{.smallcaps} your God: let all that be round about him bring presents unto him that ought to be feared.\f + \fr 76:11 \ft unto him…: Heb. to fear \f*

\v 1 I cried unto God with my voice, even unto God with my voice; and he gave ear unto me.\f + \fr 77:1 \ft of: or, for \f* 
\v 2 In the day of my trouble I sought the Lord: my sore ran in the night, and ceased not: my soul refused to be comforted.\f + \fr 77:2 \ft sore: Heb. hand \f* 
\v 3 I remembered God, and was troubled: I complained, and my spirit was overwhelmed. Selah. 
\v 4 Thou holdest mine eyes waking: I am so troubled that I cannot speak. 
\v 5 I have considered the days of old, the years of ancient times. 
\v 6 I call to remembrance my song in the night: I commune with mine own heart: and my spirit made diligent search. 
\v 7 Will the Lord cast off for ever? and will he be favourable no more? 
\v 8 Is his mercy clean gone for ever? doth his promise fail for evermore?\f + \fr 77:8 \ft for evermore: Heb. to generation and generation? \f* 
\v 9 Hath God forgotten to be gracious? hath he in anger shut up his tender mercies? Selah. 
\v 10 And I said, This is my infirmity: but I will remember the years of the right hand of the most High. 
\v 11 I will remember the works of the \sc [Lord\sc*]{.smallcaps}: surely I will remember thy wonders of old. 
\v 12 I will meditate also of all thy work, and talk of thy doings. 
\v 13 Thy way, O God, is in the sanctuary: who is so great a God as our God? 
\v 14 Thou art the God that doest wonders: thou hast declared thy strength among the people. 
\v 15 Thou hast with thine arm redeemed thy people, the sons of Jacob and Joseph. Selah. 
\v 16 The waters saw thee, O God, the waters saw thee; they were afraid: the depths also were troubled. 
\v 17 The clouds poured out water: the skies sent out a sound: thine arrows also went abroad.\f + \fr 77:17 \ft poured…: Heb. were poured forth with water \f* 
\v 18 The voice of thy thunder was in the heaven: the lightnings lightened the world: the earth trembled and shook. 
\v 19 Thy way is in the sea, and thy path in the great waters, and thy footsteps are not known. 
\v 20 Thou leddest thy people like a flock by the hand of Moses and Aaron.

Maschil of Asaph. 
\v 1 Give ear, O my people, to my law: incline your ears to the words of my mouth.\f + \fr 78:1 \ft Maschil…: or, A Psalm for Asaph to give instruction \f* 
\v 2 I will open my mouth in a parable: I will utter dark sayings of old: 
\v 3 Which we have heard and known, and our fathers have told us. 
\v 4 We will not hide them from their children, shewing to the generation to come the praises of the \sc [Lord\sc*]{.smallcaps}, and his strength, and his wonderful works that he hath done. 
\v 5 For he established a testimony in Jacob, and appointed a law in Israel, which he commanded our fathers, that they should make them known to their children: 
\v 6 That the generation to come might know them, even the children which should be born; who should arise and declare them to their children: 
\v 7 That they might set their hope in God, and not forget the works of God, but keep his commandments: 
\v 8 And might not be as their fathers, a stubborn and rebellious generation; a generation that set not their heart aright, and whose spirit was not stedfast with God.\f + \fr 78:8 \ft that…: Heb. that prepared not their heart \f* 
\v 9 The children of Ephraim, being armed, and carrying bows, turned back in the day of battle.\f + \fr 78:9 \ft carrying: Heb. throwing forth \f* 
\v 10 They kept not the covenant of God, and refused to walk in his law; 
\v 11 And forgat his works, and his wonders that he had shewed them. 
\v 12 Marvellous things did he in the sight of their fathers, in the land of Egypt, in the field of Zoan. 
\v 13 He divided the sea, and caused them to pass through; and he made the waters to stand as an heap. 
\v 14 In the daytime also he led them with a cloud, and all the night with a light of fire. 
\v 15 He clave the rocks in the wilderness, and gave them drink as out of the great depths. 
\v 16 He brought streams also out of the rock, and caused waters to run down like rivers. 
\v 17 And they sinned yet more against him by provoking the most High in the wilderness. 
\v 18 And they tempted God in their heart by asking meat for their lust. 
\v 19 Yea, they spake against God; they said, Can God furnish a table in the wilderness?\f + \fr 78:19 \ft furnish: Heb. order \f* 
\v 20 Behold, he smote the rock, that the waters gushed out, and the streams overflowed; can he give bread also? can he provide flesh for his people? 
\v 21 Therefore the \sc [Lord\sc*]{.smallcaps} heard this, and was wroth: so a fire was kindled against Jacob, and anger also came up against Israel; 
\v 22 Because they believed not in God, and trusted not in his salvation: 
\v 23 Though he had commanded the clouds from above, and opened the doors of heaven, 
\v 24 And had rained down manna upon them to eat, and had given them of the corn of heaven. 
\v 25 Man did eat angels’ food: he sent them meat to the full.\f + \fr 78:25 \ft Man…: or, Every one did eat the bread of the mighty \f* 
\v 26 He caused an east wind to blow in the heaven: and by his power he brought in the south wind.\f + \fr 78:26 \ft to blow: Heb. to go \f* 
\v 27 He rained flesh also upon them as dust, and feathered fowls like as the sand of the sea:\f + \fr 78:27 \ft feathered…: Heb. fowl of wing \f* 
\v 28 And he let it fall in the midst of their camp, round about their habitations. 
\v 29 So they did eat, and were well filled: for he gave them their own desire; 
\v 30 They were not estranged from their lust. But while their meat was yet in their mouths, 
\v 31 The wrath of God came upon them, and slew the fattest of them, and smote down the chosen men of Israel.\f + \fr 78:31 \ft smote…: Heb. made to bow \f* \f + \fr 78:31 \ft chosen…: or, young men \f* 
\v 32 For all this they sinned still, and believed not for his wondrous works. 
\v 33 Therefore their days did he consume in vanity, and their years in trouble. 
\v 34 When he slew them, then they sought him: and they returned and enquired early after God. 
\v 35 And they remembered that God was their rock, and the high God their redeemer. 
\v 36 Nevertheless they did flatter him with their mouth, and they lied unto him with their tongues. 
\v 37 For their heart was not right with him, neither were they stedfast in his covenant. 
\v 38 But he, being full of compassion, forgave their iniquity, and destroyed them not: yea, many a time turned he his anger away, and did not stir up all his wrath. 
\v 39 For he remembered that they were but flesh; a wind that passeth away, and cometh not again. 
\v 40 How oft did they provoke him in the wilderness, and grieve him in the desert!\f + \fr 78:40 \ft provoke: or, rebel against \f* 
\v 41 Yea, they turned back and tempted God, and limited the Holy One of Israel. 
\v 42 They remembered not his hand, nor the day when he delivered them from the enemy.\f + \fr 78:42 \ft from…: or, from affliction \f* 
\v 43 How he had wrought his signs in Egypt, and his wonders in the field of Zoan:\f + \fr 78:43 \ft wrought: Heb. set \f* 
\v 44 And had turned their rivers into blood; and their floods, that they could not drink. 
\v 45 He sent divers sorts of flies among them, which devoured them; and frogs, which destroyed them. 
\v 46 He gave also their increase unto the caterpiller, and their labour unto the locust. 
\v 47 He destroyed their vines with hail, and their sycomore trees with frost.\f + \fr 78:47 \ft destroyed: Heb. killed \f* \f + \fr 78:47 \ft frost: or, great hailstones \f* 
\v 48 He gave up their cattle also to the hail, and their flocks to hot thunderbolts.\f + \fr 78:48 \ft gave…: Heb. shut up \f* \f + \fr 78:48 \ft hot…: or, lightnings \f* 
\v 49 He cast upon them the fierceness of his anger, wrath, and indignation, and trouble, by sending evil angels among them. 
\v 50 He made a way to his anger; he spared not their soul from death, but gave their life over to the pestilence;\f + \fr 78:50 \ft He made…: Heb. He weighed a path \f* \f + \fr 78:50 \ft life…: or, beasts to the murrain \f* 
\v 51 And smote all the firstborn in Egypt; the chief of their strength in the tabernacles of Ham: 
\v 52 But made his own people to go forth like sheep, and guided them in the wilderness like a flock. 
\v 53 And he led them on safely, so that they feared not: but the sea overwhelmed their enemies.\f + \fr 78:53 \ft overwhelmed: Heb. covered \f* 
\v 54 And he brought them to the border of his sanctuary, even to this mountain, which his right hand had purchased. 
\v 55 He cast out the heathen also before them, and divided them an inheritance by line, and made the tribes of Israel to dwell in their tents. 
\v 56 Yet they tempted and provoked the most high God, and kept not his testimonies: 
\v 57 But turned back, and dealt unfaithfully like their fathers: they were turned aside like a deceitful bow. 
\v 58 For they provoked him to anger with their high places, and moved him to jealousy with their graven images. 
\v 59 When God heard this, he was wroth, and greatly abhorred Israel: 
\v 60 So that he forsook the tabernacle of Shiloh, the tent which he placed among men; 
\v 61 And delivered his strength into captivity, and his glory into the enemy’s hand. 
\v 62 He gave his people over also unto the sword; and was wroth with his inheritance. 
\v 63 The fire consumed their young men; and their maidens were not given to marriage.\f + \fr 78:63 \ft given…: Heb. praised \f* 
\v 64 Their priests fell by the sword; and their widows made no lamentation. 
\v 65 Then the Lord awaked as one out of sleep, and like a mighty man that shouteth by reason of wine. 
\v 66 And he smote his enemies in the hinder parts: he put them to a perpetual reproach. 
\v 67 Moreover he refused the tabernacle of Joseph, and chose not the tribe of Ephraim: 
\v 68 But chose the tribe of Judah, the mount Zion which he loved. 
\v 69 And he built his sanctuary like high palaces, like the earth which he hath established for ever.\f + \fr 78:69 \ft established: Heb. founded \f* 
\v 70 He chose David also his servant, and took him from the sheepfolds: 
\v 71 From following the ewes great with young he brought him to feed Jacob his people, and Israel his inheritance.\f + \fr 78:71 \ft following: Heb. after \f*

\v 25 He turned their heart to hate his people, to deal subtilly with his servants.

\v 6 We have sinned with our fathers, we have committed iniquity, we have done wickedly. 
\v 7 Our fathers understood not thy wonders in Egypt; they remembered not the multitude of thy mercies; but provoked him at the sea, even at the Red sea. 
\v 8 Nevertheless he saved them for his name’s sake, that he might make his mighty power to be known. 
\v 9 He rebuked the Red sea also, and it was dried up: so he led them through the depths, as through the wilderness. 
\v 10 And he saved them from the hand of him that hated them, and redeemed them from the hand of the enemy. 
\v 11 And the waters covered their enemies: there was not one of them left. 
\v 12 Then believed they his words; they sang his praise.

\v 16 They envied Moses also in the camp, and Aaron the saint of the \sc [Lord\sc*]{.smallcaps}. 
\v 17 The earth opened and swallowed up Dathan, and covered the company of Abiram. 
\v 18 And a fire was kindled in their company; the flame burned up the wicked. 
\v 19 They made a calf in Horeb, and worshipped the molten image. 
\v 20 Thus they changed their glory into the similitude of an ox that eateth grass. 
\v 21 They forgat God their saviour, which had done great things in Egypt; 
\v 22 Wondrous works in the land of Ham, and terrible things by the Red sea. 
\v 23 Therefore he said that he would destroy them, had not Moses his chosen stood before him in the breach, to turn away his wrath, lest he should destroy them.

\v 29 Thus they provoked him to anger with their inventions: and the plague brake in upon them. 
\v 30 Then stood up Phinehas, and executed judgment: and so the plague was stayed. 
\v 31 And that was counted unto him for righteousness unto all generations for evermore. 
\v 32 They angered him also at the waters of strife, so that it went ill with Moses for their sakes: 
\v 33 Because they provoked his spirit, so that he spake unadvisedly with his lips. 
\v 34 They did not destroy the nations, concerning whom the \sc [Lord\sc*]{.smallcaps} commanded them: 
\v 35 But were mingled among the heathen, and learned their works. 
\v 36 And they served their idols: which were a snare unto them. 
\v 37 Yea, they sacrificed their sons and their daughters unto devils, 
\v 38 And shed innocent blood, even the blood of their sons and of their daughters, whom they sacrificed unto the idols of Canaan: and the land was polluted with blood. 
\v 39 Thus were they defiled with their own works, and went a whoring with their own inventions. 
\v 40 Therefore was the wrath of the \sc [Lord\sc*]{.smallcaps} kindled against his people, insomuch that he abhorred his own inheritance. 
\v 41 And he gave them into the hand of the heathen; and they that hated them ruled over them.
