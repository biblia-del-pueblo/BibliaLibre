\v 40 And the son of Jonathan was Merib-baal: and Merib-baal begat Micah.

\v 5 And when his armourbearer saw that Saul was dead, he fell likewise on the sword, and died. 
\v 6 So Saul died, and his three sons, and all his house died together. 
\v 7 And when all the men of Israel that were in the valley saw that they fled, and that Saul and his sons were dead, then they forsook their cities, and fled: and the Philistines came and dwelt in them. 
\p
\v 8 And it came to pass on the morrow, when the Philistines came to strip the slain, that they found Saul and his sons fallen in mount Gilboa. 
\v 9 And when they had stripped him, they took his head, and his armour, and sent into the land of the Philistines round about, to carry tidings unto their idols, and to the people. 
\v 10 And they put his armour in the house of their gods, and fastened his head in the temple of Dagon. 
\p
\v 11 And when all Jabesh-gilead heard all that the Philistines had done to Saul, 
\v 12 They arose, all the valiant men, and took away the body of Saul, and the bodies of his sons, and brought them to Jabesh, and buried their bones under the oak in Jabesh, and fasted seven days. 
\p
\v 13 So Saul died for his transgression which he committed against the \sc [Lord\sc*]{.smallcaps}, even against the word of the \sc [Lord\sc*]{.smallcaps}, which he kept not, and also for asking counsel of one that had a familiar spirit, to enquire of it;\f + \fr 10:13 \ft committed: Heb. transgressed \f*

\v 1 Then all Israel gathered themselves to David unto Hebron, saying, Behold, we are thy bone and thy flesh. 
\v 2 And moreover in time past, even when Saul was king, thou wast he that leddest out and broughtest in Israel: and the \sc [Lord\sc*]{.smallcaps} thy God said unto thee, Thou shalt feed my people Israel, and thou shalt be ruler over my people Israel.\f + \fr 11:2 \ft in time…: Heb. both yesterday and the third day \f* \f + \fr 11:2 \ft feed: or, rule \f*

\v 5 And the inhabitants of Jebus said to David, Thou shalt not come hither. Nevertheless David took the castle of Zion, which is the city of David. 
\v 6 And David said, Whosoever smiteth the Jebusites first shall be chief and captain. So Joab the son of Zeruiah went first up, and was chief.\f + \fr 11:6 \ft chief: Heb. head \f*

\v 10 These also are the chief of the mighty men whom David had, who strengthened themselves with him in his kingdom, and with all Israel, to make him king, according to the word of the \sc [Lord\sc*]{.smallcaps} concerning Israel.\f + \fr 11:10 \ft strengthened…: or, held strongly with him \f*

\v 15 Now three of the thirty captains went down to the rock to David, into the cave of Adullam; and the host of the Philistines encamped in the valley of Rephaim.\f + \fr 11:15 \ft three…: or, three captains over the thirty \f* 
\v 16 And David was then in the hold, and the Philistines’ garrison was then at Beth-lehem. 
\v 17 And David longed, and said, Oh that one would give me drink of the water of the well of Beth-lehem, that is at the gate! 
\v 18 And the three brake through the host of the Philistines, and drew water out of the well of Beth-lehem, that was by the gate, and took it, and brought it to David: but David would not drink of it, but poured it out to the \sc [Lord\sc*]{.smallcaps}, 
\v 19 And said, My God forbid it me, that I should do this thing: shall I drink the blood of these men that have put their lives in jeopardy? for with the jeopardy of their lives they brought it.

\v 20 And Abishai the brother of Joab, he was chief of the three: for lifting up his spear against three hundred, he slew them, and had a name among the three. 
\v 21 Of the three, he was more honourable than the two; for he was their captain: howbeit he attained not to the first three. 
\v 22 Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, the son of a valiant man of Kabzeel, who had done many acts; he slew two lionlike men of Moab: also he went down and slew a lion in a pit in a snowy day.\f + \fr 11:22 \ft who had…: Heb. great of deeds \f*

\v 6 And David went up, and all Israel, to Baalah, that is, to Kirjath-jearim, which belonged to Judah, to bring up thence the ark of God the \sc [Lord\sc*]{.smallcaps}, that dwelleth between the cherubims, whose name is called on it.

\v 10 And David enquired of God, saying, Shall I go up against the Philistines? and wilt thou deliver them into mine hand? And the \sc [Lord\sc*]{.smallcaps} said unto him, Go up; for I will deliver them into thine hand. 
\v 11 So they came up to Baal-perazim; and David smote them there. Then David said, God hath broken in upon mine enemies by mine hand like the breaking forth of waters: therefore they called the name of that place Baal-perazim.\f + \fr 14:11 \ft Baal-perazim: that is, A place of breaches \f*

\v 15 And it shall be, when thou shalt hear a sound of going in the tops of the mulberry trees, that then thou shalt go out to battle: for God is gone forth before thee to smite the host of the Philistines. 
\v 16 David therefore did as God commanded him: and they smote the host of the Philistines from Gibeon even to Gazer.\f + \fr 14:16 \ft Gibeon: also called, Geba \f* 
\v 17 And the fame of David went out into all lands; and the \sc [Lord\sc*]{.smallcaps} brought the fear of him upon all nations.
\c 15
\p 
\v 1 And David made him houses in the city of David, and prepared a place for the ark of God, and pitched for it a tent. 
\v 2 Then David said, None ought to carry the ark of God but the Levites: for them hath the \sc [Lord\sc*]{.smallcaps} chosen to carry the ark of God, and to minister unto him for ever.\f + \fr 15:2 \ft None…: Heb. It is not to carry the ark of God, but for the Levites \f* 
\v 3 And David gathered all Israel together to Jerusalem, to bring up the ark of the \sc [Lord\sc*]{.smallcaps} unto his place, which he had prepared for it. 
\v 4 And David assembled the children of Aaron, and the Levites: 
\v 5 Of the sons of Kohath; Uriel the chief, and his brethren an hundred and twenty:\f + \fr 15:5 \ft brethren: or, kinsmen \f* 
\v 6 Of the sons of Merari; Asaiah the chief, and his brethren two hundred and twenty: 
\v 7 Of the sons of Gershom; Joel the chief, and his brethren an hundred and thirty: 
\v 8 Of the sons of Elizaphan; Shemaiah the chief, and his brethren two hundred: 
\v 9 Of the sons of Hebron; Eliel the chief, and his brethren fourscore: 
\v 10 Of the sons of Uzziel; Amminadab the chief, and his brethren an hundred and twelve. 
\v 11 And David called for Zadok and Abiathar the priests, and for the Levites, for Uriel, Asaiah, and Joel, Shemaiah, and Eliel, and Amminadab, 
\v 12 And said unto them, Ye are the chief of the fathers of the Levites: sanctify yourselves, both ye and your brethren, that ye may bring up the ark of the \sc [Lord\sc*]{.smallcaps} God of Israel unto the place that I have prepared for it. 
\v 13 For because ye did it not at the first, the \sc [Lord\sc*]{.smallcaps} our God made a breach upon us, for that we sought him not after the due order. 
\v 14 So the priests and the Levites sanctified themselves to bring up the ark of the \sc [Lord\sc*]{.smallcaps} God of Israel. 
\v 15 And the children of the Levites bare the ark of God upon their shoulders with the staves thereon, as Moses commanded according to the word of the \sc [Lord\sc*]{.smallcaps}. 
\v 16 And David spake to the chief of the Levites to appoint their brethren to be the singers with instruments of musick, psalteries and harps and cymbals, sounding, by lifting up the voice with joy. 
\v 17 So the Levites appointed Heman the son of Joel; and of his brethren, Asaph the son of Berechiah; and of the sons of Merari their brethren, Ethan the son of Kushaiah; 
\v 18 And with them their brethren of the second degree, Zechariah, Ben, and Jaaziel, and Shemiramoth, and Jehiel, and Unni, Eliab, and Benaiah, and Maaseiah, and Mattithiah, and Elipheleh, and Mikneiah, and Obed-edom, and Jeiel, the porters. 
\v 19 So the singers, Heman, Asaph, and Ethan, were appointed to sound with cymbals of brass; 
\v 20 And Zechariah, and Aziel, and Shemiramoth, and Jehiel, and Unni, and Eliab, and Maaseiah, and Benaiah, with psalteries on Alamoth; 
\v 21 And Mattithiah, and Elipheleh, and Mikneiah, and Obed-edom, and Jeiel, and Azaziah, with harps on the Sheminith to excel.\f + \fr 15:21 \ft on the…: or, on the eighth to oversee \f* 
\v 22 And Chenaniah, chief of the Levites, was for song: he instructed about the song, because he was skilful.\f + \fr 15:22 \ft was for…: or, was for the carriage: he instructed about the carriage \f* \f + \fr 15:22 \ft song: Heb. lifting up \f* 
\v 23 And Berechiah and Elkanah were doorkeepers for the ark. 
\v 24 And Shebaniah, and Jehoshaphat, and Nethaneel, and Amasai, and Zechariah, and Benaiah, and Eliezer, the priests, did blow with the trumpets before the ark of God: and Obed-edom and Jehiah were doorkeepers for the ark. 
\p
\v 25 So David, and the elders of Israel, and the captains over thousands, went to bring up the ark of the covenant of the \sc [Lord\sc*]{.smallcaps} out of the house of Obed-edom with joy. 
\v 26 And it came to pass, when God helped the Levites that bare the ark of the covenant of the \sc [Lord\sc*]{.smallcaps}, that they offered seven bullocks and seven rams. 
\v 27 And David was clothed with a robe of fine linen, and all the Levites that bare the ark, and the singers, and Chenaniah the master of the song with the singers: David also had upon him an ephod of linen.\f + \fr 15:27 \ft song: or, carriage \f* 
\v 28 Thus all Israel brought up the ark of the covenant of the \sc [Lord\sc*]{.smallcaps} with shouting, and with sound of the cornet, and with trumpets, and with cymbals, making a noise with psalteries and harps. 
\p
\v 29 And it came to pass, as the ark of the covenant of the \sc [Lord\sc*]{.smallcaps} came to the city of David, that Michal the daughter of Saul looking out at a window saw king David dancing and playing: and she despised him in her heart. 
\c 16
\p 
\v 1 So they brought the ark of God, and set it in the midst of the tent that David had pitched for it: and they offered burnt sacrifices and peace offerings before God. 
\v 2 And when David had made an end of offering the burnt offerings and the peace offerings, he blessed the people in the name of the \sc [Lord\sc*]{.smallcaps}. 
\v 3 And he dealt to every one of Israel, both man and woman, to every one a loaf of bread, and a good piece of flesh, and a flagon of wine. 
\p
\v 4 And he appointed certain of the Levites to minister before the ark of the \sc [Lord\sc*]{.smallcaps}, and to record, and to thank and praise the \sc [Lord\sc*]{.smallcaps} God of Israel: 
\v 5 Asaph the chief, and next to him Zechariah, Jeiel, and Shemiramoth, and Jehiel, and Mattithiah, and Eliab, and Benaiah, and Obed-edom: and Jeiel with psalteries and with harps; but Asaph made a sound with cymbals;\f + \fr 16:5 \ft with psalteries…: Heb. with instruments of psalteries and harps \f* 
\v 6 Benaiah also and Jahaziel the priests with trumpets continually before the ark of the covenant of God. 
\p
\v 7 Then on that day David delivered first this psalm to thank the \sc [Lord\sc*]{.smallcaps} into the hand of Asaph and his brethren. 
\v 8 Give thanks unto the \sc [Lord\sc*]{.smallcaps}, call upon his name, make known his deeds among the people. 
\v 9 Sing unto him, sing psalms unto him, talk ye of all his wondrous works. 
\v 10 Glory ye in his holy name: let the heart of them rejoice that seek the \sc [Lord\sc*]{.smallcaps}. 
\v 11 Seek the \sc [Lord\sc*]{.smallcaps} and his strength, seek his face continually. 
\v 12 Remember his marvellous works that he hath done, his wonders, and the judgments of his mouth; 
\v 13 O ye seed of Israel his servant, ye children of Jacob, his chosen ones. 
\v 14 He is the \sc [Lord\sc*]{.smallcaps} our God; his judgments are in all the earth. 
\v 15 Be ye mindful always of his covenant; the word which he commanded to a thousand generations; 
\v 16 Even of the covenant which he made with Abraham, and of his oath unto Isaac; 
\v 17 And hath confirmed the same to Jacob for a law, and to Israel for an everlasting covenant, 
\v 18 Saying, Unto thee will I give the land of Canaan, the lot of your inheritance;\f + \fr 16:18 \ft the lot: Heb. the cord \f* 
\v 19 When ye were but few, even a few, and strangers in it.\f + \fr 16:19 \ft few, even: Heb. men of number, etc \f* 
\v 20 And when they went from nation to nation, and from one kingdom to another people; 
\v 21 He suffered no man to do them wrong: yea, he reproved kings for their sakes, 
\v 22 Saying, Touch not mine anointed, and do my prophets no harm. 
\v 23 Sing unto the \sc [Lord\sc*]{.smallcaps}, all the earth; shew forth from day to day his salvation. 
\v 24 Declare his glory among the heathen; his marvellous works among all nations. 
\v 25 For great is the \sc [Lord\sc*]{.smallcaps}, and greatly to be praised: he also is to be feared above all gods. 
\v 26 For all the gods of the people are idols: but the \sc [Lord\sc*]{.smallcaps} made the heavens. 
\v 27 Glory and honour are in his presence; strength and gladness are in his place. 
\v 28 Give unto the \sc [Lord\sc*]{.smallcaps}, ye kindreds of the people, give unto the \sc [Lord\sc*]{.smallcaps} glory and strength. 
\v 29 Give unto the \sc [Lord\sc*]{.smallcaps} the glory due unto his name: bring an offering, and come before him: worship the \sc [Lord\sc*]{.smallcaps} in the beauty of holiness. 
\v 30 Fear before him, all the earth: the world also shall be stable, that it be not moved. 
\v 31 Let the heavens be glad, and let the earth rejoice: and let men say among the nations, The \sc [Lord\sc*]{.smallcaps} reigneth. 
\v 32 Let the sea roar, and the fulness thereof: let the fields rejoice, and all that is therein. 
\v 33 Then shall the trees of the wood sing out at the presence of the \sc [Lord\sc*]{.smallcaps}, because he cometh to judge the earth. 
\v 34 O give thanks unto the \sc [Lord\sc*]{.smallcaps}; for he is good; for his mercy endureth for ever. 
\v 35 And say ye, Save us, O God of our salvation, and gather us together, and deliver us from the heathen, that we may give thanks to thy holy name, and glory in thy praise. 
\v 36 Blessed be the \sc [Lord\sc*]{.smallcaps} God of Israel for ever and ever. And all the people said, Amen, and praised the \sc [Lord\sc*]{.smallcaps}. 
\p
\v 37 So he left there before the ark of the covenant of the \sc [Lord\sc*]{.smallcaps} Asaph and his brethren, to minister before the ark continually, as every day’s work required: 
\v 38 And Obed-edom with their brethren, threescore and eight; Obed-edom also the son of Jeduthun and Hosah to be porters: 
\v 39 And Zadok the priest, and his brethren the priests, before the tabernacle of the \sc [Lord\sc*]{.smallcaps} in the high place that was at Gibeon, 
\v 40 To offer burnt offerings unto the \sc [Lord\sc*]{.smallcaps} upon the altar of the burnt offering continually morning and evening, and to do according to all that is written in the law of the \sc [Lord\sc*]{.smallcaps}, which he commanded Israel;\f + \fr 16:40 \ft morning…: Heb. in the morning, and in the evening \f* 
\v 41 And with them Heman and Jeduthun, and the rest that were chosen, who were expressed by name, to give thanks to the \sc [Lord\sc*]{.smallcaps}, because his mercy endureth for ever; 
\v 42 And with them Heman and Jeduthun with trumpets and cymbals for those that should make a sound, and with musical instruments of God. And the sons of Jeduthun were porters.\f + \fr 16:42 \ft porters: Heb. for the gate \f* 
\v 43 And all the people departed every man to his house: and David returned to bless his house.
\c 17
\p 
\v 1 Now it came to pass, as David sat in his house, that David said to Nathan the prophet, Lo, I dwell in an house of cedars, but the ark of the covenant of the \sc [Lord\sc*]{.smallcaps} remaineth under curtains. 
\v 2 Then Nathan said unto David, Do all that is in thine heart; for God is with thee. 
\p
\v 3 And it came to pass the same night, that the word of God came to Nathan, saying, 
\v 4 Go and tell David my servant, Thus saith the \sc [Lord\sc*]{.smallcaps}, Thou shalt not build me an house to dwell in: 
\v 5 For I have not dwelt in an house since the day that I brought up Israel unto this day; but have gone from tent to tent, and from one tabernacle to another.\f + \fr 17:5 \ft have gone: Heb. have been \f* 
\v 6 Wheresoever I have walked with all Israel, spake I a word to any of the judges of Israel, whom I commanded to feed my people, saying, Why have ye not built me an house of cedars? 
\v 7 Now therefore thus shalt thou say unto my servant David, Thus saith the \sc [Lord\sc*]{.smallcaps} of hosts, I took thee from the sheepcote, even from following the sheep, that thou shouldest be ruler over my people Israel:\f + \fr 17:7 \ft from following: Heb. from after \f* 
\v 8 And I have been with thee whithersoever thou hast walked, and have cut off all thine enemies from before thee, and have made thee a name like the name of the great men that are in the earth. 
\v 9 Also I will ordain a place for my people Israel, and will plant them, and they shall dwell in their place, and shall be moved no more; neither shall the children of wickedness waste them any more, as at the beginning, 
\v 10 And since the time that I commanded judges to be over my people Israel. Moreover I will subdue all thine enemies. Furthermore I tell thee that the \sc [Lord\sc*]{.smallcaps} will build thee an house. 
\p
\v 11 And it shall come to pass, when thy days be expired that thou must go to be with thy fathers, that I will raise up thy seed after thee, which shall be of thy sons; and I will establish his kingdom. 
\v 12 He shall build me an house, and I will stablish his throne for ever. 
\v 13 I will be his father, and he shall be my son: and I will not take my mercy away from him, as I took it from him that was before thee: 
\v 14 But I will settle him in mine house and in my kingdom for ever: and his throne shall be established for evermore. 
\v 15 According to all these words, and according to all this vision, so did Nathan speak unto David. 
\p
\v 16 And David the king came and sat before the \sc [Lord\sc*]{.smallcaps}, and said, Who am I, O \sc [Lord\sc*]{.smallcaps} God, and what is mine house, that thou hast brought me hitherto? 
\v 17 And yet this was a small thing in thine eyes, O God; for thou hast also spoken of thy servant’s house for a great while to come, and hast regarded me according to the estate of a man of high degree, O \sc [Lord\sc*]{.smallcaps} God. 
\v 18 What can David speak more to thee for the honour of thy servant? for thou knowest thy servant. 
\v 19 O \sc [Lord\sc*]{.smallcaps}, for thy servant’s sake, and according to thine own heart, hast thou done all this greatness, in making known all these great things.\f + \fr 17:19 \ft great…: Heb. greatnesses \f* 
\v 20 O \sc [Lord\sc*]{.smallcaps}, there is none like thee, neither is there any God beside thee, according to all that we have heard with our ears. 
\v 21 And what one nation in the earth is like thy people Israel, whom God went to redeem to be his own people, to make thee a name of greatness and terribleness, by driving out nations from before thy people, whom thou hast redeemed out of Egypt? 
\v 22 For thy people Israel didst thou make thine own people for ever; and thou, \sc [Lord\sc*]{.smallcaps}, becamest their God. 
\v 23 Therefore now, \sc [Lord\sc*]{.smallcaps}, let the thing that thou hast spoken concerning thy servant and concerning his house be established for ever, and do as thou hast said. 
\v 24 Let it even be established, that thy name may be magnified for ever, saying, The \sc [Lord\sc*]{.smallcaps} of hosts is the God of Israel, even a God to Israel: and let the house of David thy servant be established before thee. 
\v 25 For thou, O my God, hast told thy servant that thou wilt build him an house: therefore thy servant hath found in his heart to pray before thee.\f + \fr 17:25 \ft hast…: Heb. hast revealed the ear of thy servant \f* 
\v 26 And now, \sc [Lord\sc*]{.smallcaps}, thou art God, and hast promised this goodness unto thy servant: 
\v 27 Now therefore let it please thee to bless the house of thy servant, that it may be before thee for ever: for thou blessest, O \sc [Lord\sc*]{.smallcaps}, and it shall be blessed for ever.\f + \fr 17:27 \ft let…: or, it hath pleased thee \f*
\c 18
\p 
\v 1 Now after this it came to pass, that David smote the Philistines, and subdued them, and took Gath and her towns out of the hand of the Philistines. 
\v 2 And he smote Moab; and the Moabites became David’s servants, and brought gifts. 
\p
\v 3 And David smote Hadarezer king of Zobah unto Hamath, as he went to stablish his dominion by the river Euphrates.\f + \fr 18:3 \ft Hadarezer: or, Hadadezer \f* 
\v 4 And David took from him a thousand chariots, and seven thousand horsemen, and twenty thousand footmen: David also houghed all the chariot horses, but reserved of them an hundred chariots.\f + \fr 18:4 \ft seven…: or, seven hundred \f* 
\v 5 And when the Syrians of Damascus came to help Hadarezer king of Zobah, David slew of the Syrians two and twenty thousand men.\f + \fr 18:5 \ft Damascus: Heb. Darmesek \f* 
\v 6 Then David put garrisons in Syria-damascus; and the Syrians became David’s servants, and brought gifts. Thus the \sc [Lord\sc*]{.smallcaps} preserved David whithersoever he went. 
\v 7 And David took the shields of gold that were on the servants of Hadarezer, and brought them to Jerusalem. 
\v 8 Likewise from Tibhath, and from Chun, cities of Hadarezer, brought David very much brass, wherewith Solomon made the brasen sea, and the pillars, and the vessels of brass.\f + \fr 18:8 \ft Tibhath…: called in the book of Samuel Betah, and Berothai \f* 
\p
\v 9 Now when Tou king of Hamath heard how David had smitten all the host of Hadarezer king of Zobah;\f + \fr 18:9 \ft Tou: also called, Toi \f* 
\v 10 He sent Hadoram his son to king David, to enquire of his welfare, and to congratulate him, because he had fought against Hadarezer, and smitten him; (for Hadarezer had war with Tou;) and with him all manner of vessels of gold and silver and brass.\f + \fr 18:10 \ft Hadoram: also called, Joram \f* \f + \fr 18:10 \ft to enquire…: or, to salute \f* \f + \fr 18:10 \ft to congratulate: Heb. to bless \f* \f + \fr 18:10 \ft had war: Heb. was the man of wars \f* 
\p
\v 11 Them also king David dedicated unto the \sc [Lord\sc*]{.smallcaps}, with the silver and the gold that he brought from all these nations; from Edom, and from Moab, and from the children of Ammon, and from the Philistines, and from Amalek. 
\v 12 Moreover Abishai the son of Zeruiah slew of the Edomites in the valley of salt eighteen thousand.\f + \fr 18:12 \ft Abishai: Heb. Abshai \f* 
\p
\v 13 And he put garrisons in Edom; and all the Edomites became David’s servants. Thus the \sc [Lord\sc*]{.smallcaps} preserved David whithersoever he went. 
\p
\v 14 So David reigned over all Israel, and executed judgment and justice among all his people. 
\v 15 And Joab the son of Zeruiah was over the host; and Jehoshaphat the son of Ahilud, recorder.\f + \fr 18:15 \ft recorder: or, remembrancer \f* 
\v 16 And Zadok the son of Ahitub, and Abimelech the son of Abiathar, were the priests; and Shavsha was scribe;\f + \fr 18:16 \ft Abimelech: also called, Ahimelech \f* \f + \fr 18:16 \ft Shavsha: also called Seraiah or Shisha \f* 
\v 17 And Benaiah the son of Jehoiada was over the Cherethites and the Pelethites; and the sons of David were chief about the king.\f + \fr 18:17 \ft about…: Heb. at the hand of the king \f*
\c 19
\p 
\v 1 Now it came to pass after this, that Nahash the king of the children of Ammon died, and his son reigned in his stead. 
\v 2 And David said, I will shew kindness unto Hanun the son of Nahash, because his father shewed kindness to me. And David sent messengers to comfort him concerning his father. So the servants of David came into the land of the children of Ammon to Hanun, to comfort him. 
\v 3 But the princes of the children of Ammon said to Hanun, Thinkest thou that David doth honour thy father, that he hath sent comforters unto thee? are not his servants come unto thee for to search, and to overthrow, and to spy out the land?\f + \fr 19:3 \ft Thinkest…: Heb. In thine eyes doth David, etc \f* 
\v 4 Wherefore Hanun took David’s servants, and shaved them, and cut off their garments in the midst hard by their buttocks, and sent them away. 
\v 5 Then there went certain, and told David how the men were served. And he sent to meet them: for the men were greatly ashamed. And the king said, Tarry at Jericho until your beards be grown, and then return. 
\p
\v 6 And when the children of Ammon saw that they had made themselves odious to David, Hanun and the children of Ammon sent a thousand talents of silver to hire them chariots and horsemen out of Mesopotamia, and out of Syria-maachah, and out of Zobah.\f + \fr 19:6 \ft odious: Heb. to stink \f* 
\v 7 So they hired thirty and two thousand chariots, and the king of Maachah and his people; who came and pitched before Medeba. And the children of Ammon gathered themselves together from their cities, and came to battle. 
\v 8 And when David heard of it, he sent Joab, and all the host of the mighty men. 
\v 9 And the children of Ammon came out, and put the battle in array before the gate of the city: and the kings that were come were by themselves in the field. 
\v 10 Now when Joab saw that the battle was set against him before and behind, he chose out of all the choice of Israel, and put them in array against the Syrians.\f + \fr 19:10 \ft the battle…: Heb. the face of the battle was \f* \f + \fr 19:10 \ft choice: or, young men \f* 
\v 11 And the rest of the people he delivered unto the hand of Abishai his brother, and they set themselves in array against the children of Ammon.\f + \fr 19:11 \ft Abishai: Heb. Abshai \f* 
\v 12 And he said, If the Syrians be too strong for me, then thou shalt help me: but if the children of Ammon be too strong for thee, then I will help thee. 
\v 13 Be of good courage, and let us behave ourselves valiantly for our people, and for the cities of our God: and let the \sc [Lord\sc*]{.smallcaps} do that which is good in his sight. 
\v 14 So Joab and the people that were with him drew nigh before the Syrians unto the battle; and they fled before him. 
\v 15 And when the children of Ammon saw that the Syrians were fled, they likewise fled before Abishai his brother, and entered into the city. Then Joab came to Jerusalem. 
\p
\v 16 And when the Syrians saw that they were put to the worse before Israel, they sent messengers, and drew forth the Syrians that were beyond the river: and Shophach the captain of the host of Hadarezer went before them.\f + \fr 19:16 \ft river: that is, Euphrates \f* \f + \fr 19:16 \ft Shophach: also called, Shobach \f* 
\v 17 And it was told David; and he gathered all Israel, and passed over Jordan, and came upon them, and set the battle in array against them. So when David had put the battle in array against the Syrians, they fought with him. 
\v 18 But the Syrians fled before Israel; and David slew of the Syrians seven thousand men which fought in chariots, and forty thousand footmen, and killed Shophach the captain of the host. 
\v 19 And when the servants of Hadarezer saw that they were put to the worse before Israel, they made peace with David, and became his servants: neither would the Syrians help the children of Ammon any more.
\c 20
\p 
\v 1 And it came to pass, that after the year was expired, at the time that kings go out to battle, Joab led forth the power of the army, and wasted the country of the children of Ammon, and came and besieged Rabbah. But David tarried at Jerusalem. And Joab smote Rabbah, and destroyed it.\f + \fr 20:1 \ft after…: Heb. at the return of the year \f* 
\v 2 And David took the crown of their king from off his head, and found it to weigh a talent of gold, and there were precious stones in it; and it was set upon David’s head: and he brought also exceeding much spoil out of the city.\f + \fr 20:2 \ft to weigh: Heb. the weight of \f* 
\v 3 And he brought out the people that were in it, and cut them with saws, and with harrows of iron, and with axes. Even so dealt David with all the cities of the children of Ammon. And David and all the people returned to Jerusalem. 
\p
\v 4 And it came to pass after this, that there arose war at Gezer with the Philistines; at which time Sibbechai the Hushathite slew Sippai, that was of the children of the giant: and they were subdued.\f + \fr 20:4 \ft arose: or, continued: Heb. stood \f* \f + \fr 20:4 \ft Gezer: also called, Gob \f* \f + \fr 20:4 \ft Sippai: also called, Saph \f* \f + \fr 20:4 \ft the giant: or, Rapha \f* 
\v 5 And there was war again with the Philistines; and Elhanan the son of Jair slew Lahmi the brother of Goliath the Gittite, whose spear staff was like a weaver’s beam.\f + \fr 20:5 \ft Jair: also called, Jaare-oregim \f* 
\v 6 And yet again there was war at Gath, where was a man of great stature, whose fingers and toes were four and twenty, six on each hand, and six on each foot: and he also was the son of the giant.\f + \fr 20:6 \ft great…: Heb. measure \f* \f + \fr 20:6 \ft the son…: Heb. born to the giant, or, Rapha \f* 
\v 7 But when he defied Israel, Jonathan the son of Shimea David’s brother slew him.\f + \fr 20:7 \ft defied: or, reproached \f* \f + \fr 20:7 \ft Shimea: also called Shammah \f* 
\v 8 These were born unto the giant in Gath; and they fell by the hand of David, and by the hand of his servants.
\c 21
\p 
\v 1 And Satan stood up against Israel, and provoked David to number Israel. 
\v 2 And David said to Joab and to the rulers of the people, Go, number Israel from Beer-sheba even to Dan; and bring the number of them to me, that I may know it. 
\v 3 And Joab answered, The \sc [Lord\sc*]{.smallcaps} make his people an hundred times so many more as they be: but, my lord the king, are they not all my lord’s servants? why then doth my lord require this thing? why will he be a cause of trespass to Israel? 
\v 4 Nevertheless the king’s word prevailed against Joab. Wherefore Joab departed, and went throughout all Israel, and came to Jerusalem. 
\p
\v 5 And Joab gave the sum of the number of the people unto David. And all they of Israel were a thousand thousand and an hundred thousand men that drew sword: and Judah was four hundred threescore and ten thousand men that drew sword. 
\v 6 But Levi and Benjamin counted he not among them: for the king’s word was abominable to Joab. 
\p
\v 7 And God was displeased with this thing; therefore he smote Israel.^\sc 21:7 And…: Heb. And it was evil in the eyes of the [Lord\sc* concerning this thing] 
\v 8 And David said unto God, I have sinned greatly, because I have done this thing: but now, I beseech thee, do away the iniquity of thy servant; for I have done very foolishly. 
\p
\v 9 And the \sc [Lord\sc*]{.smallcaps} spake unto Gad, David’s seer, saying, 
\v 10 Go and tell David, saying, Thus saith the \sc [Lord\sc*]{.smallcaps}, I offer thee three things: choose thee one of them, that I may do it unto thee.\f + \fr 21:10 \ft offer: Heb. stretch out \f* 
\v 11 So Gad came to David, and said unto him, Thus saith the \sc [Lord\sc*]{.smallcaps}, Choose thee\f + \fr 21:11 \ft Choose…: Heb. Take to thee \f* 
\v 12 Either three years’ famine; or three months to be destroyed before thy foes, while that the sword of thine enemies overtaketh thee; or else three days the sword of the \sc [Lord\sc*]{.smallcaps}, even the pestilence, in the land, and the angel of the \sc [Lord\sc*]{.smallcaps} destroying throughout all the coasts of Israel. Now therefore advise thyself what word I shall bring again to him that sent me. 
\v 13 And David said unto Gad, I am in a great strait: let me fall now into the hand of the \sc [Lord\sc*]{.smallcaps}; for very great are his mercies: but let me not fall into the hand of man.\f + \fr 21:13 \ft very great: or, very many \f* 
\p
\v 14 So the \sc [Lord\sc*]{.smallcaps} sent pestilence upon Israel: and there fell of Israel seventy thousand men. 
\v 15 And God sent an angel unto Jerusalem to destroy it: and as he was destroying, the \sc [Lord\sc*]{.smallcaps} beheld, and he repented him of the evil, and said to the angel that destroyed, It is enough, stay now thine hand. And the angel of the \sc [Lord\sc*]{.smallcaps} stood by the threshingfloor of Ornan the Jebusite.\f + \fr 21:15 \ft Ornan: also called, Araunah \f* 
\v 16 And David lifted up his eyes, and saw the angel of the \sc [Lord\sc*]{.smallcaps} stand between the earth and the heaven, having a drawn sword in his hand stretched out over Jerusalem. Then David and the elders of Israel, who were clothed in sackcloth, fell upon their faces. 
\v 17 And David said unto God, Is it not I that commanded the people to be numbered? even I it is that have sinned and done evil indeed; but as for these sheep, what have they done? let thine hand, I pray thee, O \sc [Lord\sc*]{.smallcaps} my God, be on me, and on my father’s house; but not on thy people, that they should be plagued. 
\p
\v 18 Then the angel of the \sc [Lord\sc*]{.smallcaps} commanded Gad to say to David, that David should go up, and set up an altar unto the \sc [Lord\sc*]{.smallcaps} in the threshingfloor of Ornan the Jebusite. 
\v 19 And David went up at the saying of Gad, which he spake in the name of the \sc [Lord\sc*]{.smallcaps}. 
\v 20 And Ornan turned back, and saw the angel; and his four sons with him hid themselves. Now Ornan was threshing wheat.\f + \fr 21:20 \ft And Ornan…: or, When Ornan turned back and saw the angel, then he and his four sons with him hid themselves \f* 
\v 21 And as David came to Ornan, Ornan looked and saw David, and went out of the threshingfloor, and bowed himself to David with his face to the ground. 
\v 22 Then David said to Ornan, Grant me the place of this threshingfloor, that I may build an altar therein unto the \sc [Lord\sc*]{.smallcaps}: thou shalt grant it me for the full price: that the plague may be stayed from the people.\f + \fr 21:22 \ft Grant: Heb. Give \f* 
\v 23 And Ornan said unto David, Take it to thee, and let my lord the king do that which is good in his eyes: lo, I give thee the oxen also for burnt offerings, and the threshing instruments for wood, and the wheat for the meat offering; I give it all. 
\v 24 And king David said to Ornan, Nay; but I will verily buy it for the full price: for I will not take that which is thine for the \sc [Lord\sc*]{.smallcaps}, nor offer burnt offerings without cost. 
\v 25 So David gave to Ornan for the place six hundred shekels of gold by weight. 
\v 26 And David built there an altar unto the \sc [Lord\sc*]{.smallcaps}, and offered burnt offerings and peace offerings, and called upon the \sc [Lord\sc*]{.smallcaps}; and he answered him from heaven by fire upon the altar of burnt offering. 
\v 27 And the \sc [Lord\sc*]{.smallcaps} commanded the angel; and he put up his sword again into the sheath thereof. 
\p
\v 28 At that time when David saw that the \sc [Lord\sc*]{.smallcaps} had answered him in the threshingfloor of Ornan the Jebusite, then he sacrificed there. 
\v 29 For the tabernacle of the \sc [Lord\sc*]{.smallcaps}, which Moses made in the wilderness, and the altar of the burnt offering, were at that season in the high place at Gibeon. 
\v 30 But David could not go before it to enquire of God: for he was afraid because of the sword of the angel of the \sc [Lord\sc*]{.smallcaps}. 
\c 22
\p 
\v 1 Then David said, This is the house of the \sc [Lord\sc*]{.smallcaps} God, and this is the altar of the burnt offering for Israel. 
\v 2 And David commanded to gather together the strangers that were in the land of Israel; and he set masons to hew wrought stones to build the house of God. 
\v 3 And David prepared iron in abundance for the nails for the doors of the gates, and for the joinings; and brass in abundance without weight; 
\v 4 Also cedar trees in abundance: for the Zidonians and they of Tyre brought much cedar wood to David. 
\v 5 And David said, Solomon my son is young and tender, and the house that is to be builded for the \sc [Lord\sc*]{.smallcaps} must be exceeding magnifical, of fame and of glory throughout all countries: I will therefore now make preparation for it. So David prepared abundantly before his death. 
\p
\v 6 Then he called for Solomon his son, and charged him to build an house for the \sc [Lord\sc*]{.smallcaps} God of Israel. 
\v 7 And David said to Solomon, My son, as for me, it was in my mind to build an house unto the name of the \sc [Lord\sc*]{.smallcaps} my God: 
\v 8 But the word of the \sc [Lord\sc*]{.smallcaps} came to me, saying, Thou hast shed blood abundantly, and hast made great wars: thou shalt not build an house unto my name, because thou hast shed much blood upon the earth in my sight. 
\v 9 Behold, a son shall be born to thee, who shall be a man of rest; and I will give him rest from all his enemies round about: for his name shall be Solomon, and I will give peace and quietness unto Israel in his days.\f + \fr 22:9 \ft Solomon: that is, Peaceable \f* 
\v 10 He shall build an house for my name; and he shall be my son, and I will be his father; and I will establish the throne of his kingdom over Israel for ever. 
\v 11 Now, my son, the \sc [Lord\sc*]{.smallcaps} be with thee; and prosper thou, and build the house of the \sc [Lord\sc*]{.smallcaps} thy God, as he hath said of thee. 
\v 12 Only the \sc [Lord\sc*]{.smallcaps} give thee wisdom and understanding, and give thee charge concerning Israel, that thou mayest keep the law of the \sc [Lord\sc*]{.smallcaps} thy God. 
\v 13 Then shalt thou prosper, if thou takest heed to fulfil the statutes and judgments which the \sc [Lord\sc*]{.smallcaps} charged Moses with concerning Israel: be strong, and of good courage; dread not, nor be dismayed. 
\v 14 Now, behold, in my trouble I have prepared for the house of the \sc [Lord\sc*]{.smallcaps} an hundred thousand talents of gold, and a thousand thousand talents of silver; and of brass and iron without weight; for it is in abundance: timber also and stone have I prepared; and thou mayest add thereto.\f + \fr 22:14 \ft trouble: or, poverty \f* 
\v 15 Moreover there are workmen with thee in abundance, hewers and workers of stone and timber, and all manner of cunning men for every manner of work.\f + \fr 22:15 \ft workers…: that is, masons and carpenters \f* 
\v 16 Of the gold, the silver, and the brass, and the iron, there is no number. Arise therefore, and be doing, and the \sc [Lord\sc*]{.smallcaps} be with thee. 
\p
\v 17 David also commanded all the princes of Israel to help Solomon his son, saying, 
\v 18 Is not the \sc [Lord\sc*]{.smallcaps} your God with you? and hath he not given you rest on every side? for he hath given the inhabitants of the land into mine hand; and the land is subdued before the \sc [Lord\sc*]{.smallcaps}, and before his people. 
\v 19 Now set your heart and your soul to seek the \sc [Lord\sc*]{.smallcaps} your God; arise therefore, and build ye the sanctuary of the \sc [Lord\sc*]{.smallcaps} God, to bring the ark of the covenant of the \sc [Lord\sc*]{.smallcaps}, and the holy vessels of God, into the house that is to be built to the name of the \sc [Lord\sc*]{.smallcaps}. 
\c 23
\p 
\v 1 So when David was old and full of days, he made Solomon his son king over Israel. 
\p
\v 2 And he gathered together all the princes of Israel, with the priests and the Levites. 
\v 3 Now the Levites were numbered from the age of thirty years and upward: and their number by their polls, man by man, was thirty and eight thousand. 
\v 4 Of which, twenty and four thousand were to set forward the work of the house of the \sc [Lord\sc*]{.smallcaps}; and six thousand were officers and judges:\f + \fr 23:4 \ft set…: or, oversee \f* 
\v 5 Moreover four thousand were porters; and four thousand praised the \sc [Lord\sc*]{.smallcaps} with the instruments which I made, said David, to praise therewith. 
\v 6 And David divided them into courses among the sons of Levi, namely, Gershon, Kohath, and Merari.\f + \fr 23:6 \ft courses: Heb. divisions \f* 
\p
\v 7 Of the Gershonites were, Laadan, and Shimei.\f + \fr 23:7 \ft Laadan: or, Libni \f* 
\v 8 The sons of Laadan; the chief was Jehiel, and Zetham, and Joel, three. 
\v 9 The sons of Shimei; Shelomith, and Haziel, and Haran, three. These were the chief of the fathers of Laadan. 
\v 10 And the sons of Shimei were, Jahath, Zina, and Jeush, and Beriah. These four were the sons of Shimei.\f + \fr 23:10 \ft Zina: or, Zizah \f* 
\v 11 And Jahath was the chief, and Zizah the second: but Jeush and Beriah had not many sons; therefore they were in one reckoning, according to their father’s house.\f + \fr 23:11 \ft had…: Heb. did not multiply sons \f* 
\p
\v 12 The sons of Kohath; Amram, Izhar, Hebron, and Uzziel, four. 
\v 13 The sons of Amram; Aaron and Moses: and Aaron was separated, that he should sanctify the most holy things, he and his sons for ever, to burn incense before the \sc [Lord\sc*]{.smallcaps}, to minister unto him, and to bless in his name for ever. 
\v 14 Now concerning Moses the man of God, his sons were named of the tribe of Levi. 
\v 15 The sons of Moses were, Gershom, and Eliezer. 
\v 16 Of the sons of Gershom, Shebuel was the chief.\f + \fr 23:16 \ft Shebuel: also called, Shubael \f* 
\v 17 And the sons of Eliezer were, Rehabiah the chief. And Eliezer had none other sons; but the sons of Rehabiah were very many.\f + \fr 23:17 \ft the chief: or, the first \f* \f + \fr 23:17 \ft very many: Heb. highly multiplied \f* 
\v 18 Of the sons of Izhar; Shelomith the chief.\f + \fr 23:18 \ft Shelomith: also called, Shelomoth \f* 
\v 19 Of the sons of Hebron; Jeriah the first, Amariah the second, Jahaziel the third, and Jekameam the fourth. 
\v 20 Of the sons of Uzziel; Michah the first, and Jesiah the second. 
\p
\v 21 The sons of Merari; Mahli, and Mushi. The sons of Mahli; Eleazar, and Kish. 
\v 22 And Eleazar died, and had no sons, but daughters: and their brethren the sons of Kish took them.\f + \fr 23:22 \ft brethren: or, kinsmen \f* 
\v 23 The sons of Mushi; Mahli, and Eder, and Jeremoth, three. 
\p
\v 24 These were the sons of Levi after the house of their fathers; even the chief of the fathers, as they were counted by number of names by their polls, that did the work for the service of the house of the \sc [Lord\sc*]{.smallcaps}, from the age of twenty years and upward. 
\v 25 For David said, The \sc [Lord\sc*]{.smallcaps} God of Israel hath given rest unto his people, that they may dwell in Jerusalem for ever:\f + \fr 23:25 \ft that…: or, and he dwelleth in Jerusalem, etc \f* 
\v 26 And also unto the Levites; they shall no more carry the tabernacle, nor any vessels of it for the service thereof. 
\v 27 For by the last words of David the Levites were numbered from twenty years old and above:\f + \fr 23:27 \ft numbered: Heb. number \f* 
\v 28 Because their office was to wait on the sons of Aaron for the service of the house of the \sc [Lord\sc*]{.smallcaps}, in the courts, and in the chambers, and in the purifying of all holy things, and the work of the service of the house of God;\f + \fr 23:28 \ft their…: Heb. their station was at the hand of the sons of Aaron \f* 
\v 29 Both for the shewbread, and for the fine flour for meat offering, and for the unleavened cakes, and for that which is baked in the pan, and for that which is fried, and for all manner of measure and size;\f + \fr 23:29 \ft pan: or, flat plate \f* 
\v 30 And to stand every morning to thank and praise the \sc [Lord\sc*]{.smallcaps}, and likewise at even; 
\v 31 And to offer all burnt sacrifices unto the \sc [Lord\sc*]{.smallcaps} in the sabbaths, in the new moons, and on the set feasts, by number, according to the order commanded unto them, continually before the \sc [Lord\sc*]{.smallcaps}: 
\v 32 And that they should keep the charge of the tabernacle of the congregation, and the charge of the holy place, and the charge of the sons of Aaron their brethren, in the service of the house of the \sc [Lord\sc*]{.smallcaps}.
\c 24
\p 
\v 1 Now these are the divisions of the sons of Aaron. The sons of Aaron; Nadab, and Abihu, Eleazar, and Ithamar. 
\v 2 But Nadab and Abihu died before their father, and had no children: therefore Eleazar and Ithamar executed the priest’s office. 
\v 3 And David distributed them, both Zadok of the sons of Eleazar, and Ahimelech of the sons of Ithamar, according to their offices in their service. 
\v 4 And there were more chief men found of the sons of Eleazar than of the sons of Ithamar; and thus were they divided. Among the sons of Eleazar there were sixteen chief men of the house of their fathers, and eight among the sons of Ithamar according to the house of their fathers. 
\v 5 Thus were they divided by lot, one sort with another; for the governors of the sanctuary, and governors of the house of God, were of the sons of Eleazar, and of the sons of Ithamar. 
\v 6 And Shemaiah the son of Nethaneel the scribe, one of the Levites, wrote them before the king, and the princes, and Zadok the priest, and Ahimelech the son of Abiathar, and before the chief of the fathers of the priests and Levites: one principal household being taken for Eleazar, and one taken for Ithamar.\f + \fr 24:6 \ft principal…: Heb. house of the father \f* 
\v 7 Now the first lot came forth to Jehoiarib, the second to Jedaiah, 
\v 8 The third to Harim, the fourth to Seorim, 
\v 9 The fifth to Malchijah, the sixth to Mijamin, 
\v 10 The seventh to Hakkoz, the eighth to Abijah, 
\v 11 The ninth to Jeshua, the tenth to Shecaniah, 
\v 12 The eleventh to Eliashib, the twelfth to Jakim, 
\v 13 The thirteenth to Huppah, the fourteenth to Jeshebeab,

\v 17 The one and twentieth to Jachin, the two and twentieth to Gamul, 
\v 18 The three and twentieth to Delaiah, the four and twentieth to Maaziah. 
\v 19 These were the orderings of them in their service to come into the house of the \sc [Lord\sc*]{.smallcaps}, according to their manner, under Aaron their father, as the \sc [Lord\sc*]{.smallcaps} God of Israel had commanded him. 
\p
\v 20 And the rest of the sons of Levi were these: Of the sons of Amram; Shubael: of the sons of Shubael; Jehdeiah.\f + \fr 24:20 \ft Shubael: also called, Shebuel \f* 
\v 21 Concerning Rehabiah: of the sons of Rehabiah, the first was Isshiah.

\v 23 And the sons of Hebron; Jeriah the first, Amariah the second, Jahaziel the third, Jekameam the fourth. 
\v 24 Of the sons of Uzziel; Michah: of the sons of Michah; Shamir. 
\v 25 The brother of Michah was Isshiah: of the sons of Isshiah; Zechariah. 
\v 26 The sons of Merari were Mahli and Mushi: the sons of Jaaziah; Beno. 
\p
\v 27 The sons of Merari by Jaaziah; Beno, and Shoham, and Zaccur, and Ibri. 
\v 28 Of Mahli came Eleazar, who had no sons. 
\v 29 Concerning Kish: the son of Kish was Jerahmeel. 
\v 30 The sons also of Mushi; Mahli, and Eder, and Jerimoth. These were the sons of the Levites after the house of their fathers. 
\v 31 These likewise cast lots over against their brethren the sons of Aaron in the presence of David the king, and Zadok, and Ahimelech, and the chief of the fathers of the priests and Levites, even the principal fathers over against their younger brethren. 
\c 25
\p 
\v 1 Moreover David and the captains of the host separated to the service of the sons of Asaph, and of Heman, and of Jeduthun, who should prophesy with harps, with psalteries, and with cymbals: and the number of the workmen according to their service was: 
\v 2 Of the sons of Asaph; Zaccur, and Joseph, and Nethaniah, and Asarelah, the sons of Asaph under the hands of Asaph, which prophesied according to the order of the king.\f + \fr 25:2 \ft Asarelah: otherwise called Jesharelah \f* \f + \fr 25:2 \ft according…: Heb. by the hands of the king \f*

\v 5 All these were the sons of Heman the king’s seer in the words of God, to lift up the horn. And God gave to Heman fourteen sons and three daughters.\f + \fr 25:5 \ft words: or, matters \f* 
\v 6 All these were under the hands of their father for song in the house of the \sc [Lord\sc*]{.smallcaps}, with cymbals, psalteries, and harps, for the service of the house of God, according to the king’s order to Asaph, Jeduthun, and Heman.\f + \fr 25:6 \ft according…: Heb. by the hands of the king \f* 
\v 7 So the number of them, with their brethren that were instructed in the songs of the \sc [Lord\sc*]{.smallcaps}, even all that were cunning, was two hundred fourscore and eight. 
\p
\v 8 And they cast lots, ward against ward, as well the small as the great, the teacher as the scholar.

\v 11 Hilkiah the second, Tebaliah the third, Zechariah the fourth: all the sons and brethren of Hosah were thirteen. 
\v 12 Among these were the divisions of the porters, even among the chief men, having wards one against another, to minister in the house of the \sc [Lord\sc*]{.smallcaps}.

\v 1 Now the children of Israel after their number, to wit, the chief fathers and captains of thousands and hundreds, and their officers that served the king in any matter of the courses, which came in and went out month by month throughout all the months of the year, of every course were twenty and four thousand. 
\v 2 Over the first course for the first month was Jashobeam the son of Zabdiel: and in his course were twenty and four thousand. 
\v 3 Of the children of Perez was the chief of all the captains of the host for the first month. 
\v 4 And over the course of the second month was Dodai an Ahohite, and of his course was Mikloth also the ruler: in his course likewise were twenty and four thousand.\f + \fr 27:4 \ft Dodai: also called, Dodo \f*

\v 17 Of the Levites, Hashabiah the son of Kemuel: of the Aaronites, Zadok:

\v 21 Of the half tribe of Manasseh in Gilead, Iddo the son of Zechariah: of Benjamin, Jaasiel the son of Abner: 
\v 22 Of Dan, Azareel the son of Jeroham. These were the princes of the tribes of Israel. 
\p
\v 23 But David took not the number of them from twenty years old and under: because the \sc [Lord\sc*]{.smallcaps} had said he would increase Israel like to the stars of the heavens. 
\v 24 Joab the son of Zeruiah began to number, but he finished not, because there fell wrath for it against Israel; neither was the number put in the account of the chronicles of king David.\f + \fr 27:24 \ft was: Heb. ascended \f* 
\p
\v 25 And over the king’s treasures was Azmaveth the son of Adiel: and over the storehouses in the fields, in the cities, and in the villages, and in the castles, was Jehonathan the son of Uzziah: 
\v 26 And over them that did the work of the field for tillage of the ground was Ezri the son of Chelub: 
\v 27 And over the vineyards was Shimei the Ramathite: over the increase of the vineyards for the wine cellars was Zabdi the Shiphmite:\f + \fr 27:27 \ft over the increase…: Heb. over that which was of the vineyards \f* 
\v 28 And over the olive trees and the sycomore trees that were in the low plains was Baal-hanan the Gederite: and over the cellars of oil was Joash: 
\v 29 And over the herds that fed in Sharon was Shitrai the Sharonite: and over the herds that were in the valleys was Shaphat the son of Adlai: 
\v 30 Over the camels also was Obil the Ishmaelite: and over the asses was Jehdeiah the Meronothite: 
\v 31 And over the flocks was Jaziz the Hagerite. All these were the rulers of the substance which was king David’s. 
\v 32 Also Jonathan David’s uncle was a counsellor, a wise man, and a scribe: and Jehiel the son of Hachmoni was with the king’s sons:\f + \fr 27:32 \ft scribe: or, secretary \f* \f + \fr 27:32 \ft son…: or, Hachmonite \f* 
\v 33 And Ahithophel was the king’s counsellor: and Hushai the Archite was the king’s companion: 
\v 34 And after Ahithophel was Jehoiada the son of Benaiah, and Abiathar: and the general of the king’s army was Joab.
\c 28
\p 
\v 1 And David assembled all the princes of Israel, the princes of the tribes, and the captains of the companies that ministered to the king by course, and the captains over the thousands, and captains over the hundreds, and the stewards over all the substance and possession of the king, and of his sons, with the officers, and with the mighty men, and with all the valiant men, unto Jerusalem.\f + \fr 28:1 \ft possession: or, cattle \f* \f + \fr 28:1 \ft and of…: or, and his sons \f* \f + \fr 28:1 \ft officers: or, eunuchs \f* 
\v 2 Then David the king stood up upon his feet, and said, Hear me, my brethren, and my people: As for me, I had in mine heart to build an house of rest for the ark of the covenant of the \sc [Lord\sc*]{.smallcaps}, and for the footstool of our God, and had made ready for the building: 
\v 3 But God said unto me, Thou shalt not build an house for my name, because thou hast been a man of war, and hast shed blood.\f + \fr 28:3 \ft blood: Heb. bloods \f* 
\v 4 Howbeit the \sc [Lord\sc*]{.smallcaps} God of Israel chose me before all the house of my father to be king over Israel for ever: for he hath chosen Judah to be the ruler; and of the house of Judah, the house of my father; and among the sons of my father he liked me to make me king over all Israel: 
\v 5 And of all my sons, (for the \sc [Lord\sc*]{.smallcaps} hath given me many sons,) he hath chosen Solomon my son to sit upon the throne of the kingdom of the \sc [Lord\sc*]{.smallcaps} over Israel. 
\v 6 And he said unto me, Solomon thy son, he shall build my house and my courts: for I have chosen him to be my son, and I will be his father. 
\v 7 Moreover I will establish his kingdom for ever, if he be constant to do my commandments and my judgments, as at this day.\f + \fr 28:7 \ft constant: Heb. strong \f* 
\v 8 Now therefore in the sight of all Israel the congregation of the \sc [Lord\sc*]{.smallcaps}, and in the audience of our God, keep and seek for all the commandments of the \sc [Lord\sc*]{.smallcaps} your God: that ye may possess this good land, and leave it for an inheritance for your children after you for ever. 
\p
\v 9 And thou, Solomon my son, know thou the God of thy father, and serve him with a perfect heart and with a willing mind: for the \sc [Lord\sc*]{.smallcaps} searcheth all hearts, and understandeth all the imaginations of the thoughts: if thou seek him, he will be found of thee; but if thou forsake him, he will cast thee off for ever. 
\v 10 Take heed now; for the \sc [Lord\sc*]{.smallcaps} hath chosen thee to build an house for the sanctuary: be strong, and do it. 
\p
\v 11 Then David gave to Solomon his son the pattern of the porch, and of the houses thereof, and of the treasuries thereof, and of the upper chambers thereof, and of the inner parlours thereof, and of the place of the mercy seat, 
\v 12 And the pattern of all that he had by the spirit, of the courts of the house of the \sc [Lord\sc*]{.smallcaps}, and of all the chambers round about, of the treasuries of the house of God, and of the treasuries of the dedicated things:\f + \fr 28:12 \ft of all that…: Heb. of all that was with him \f* 
\v 13 Also for the courses of the priests and the Levites, and for all the work of the service of the house of the \sc [Lord\sc*]{.smallcaps}, and for all the vessels of service in the house of the \sc [Lord\sc*]{.smallcaps}. 
\v 14 He gave of gold by weight for things of gold, for all instruments of all manner of service; silver also for all instruments of silver by weight, for all instruments of every kind of service: 
\v 15 Even the weight for the candlesticks of gold, and for their lamps of gold, by weight for every candlestick, and for the lamps thereof: and for the candlesticks of silver by weight, both for the candlestick, and also for the lamps thereof, according to the use of every candlestick. 
\v 16 And by weight he gave gold for the tables of shewbread, for every table; and likewise silver for the tables of silver: 
\v 17 Also pure gold for the fleshhooks, and the bowls, and the cups: and for the golden basons he gave gold by weight for every bason; and likewise silver by weight for every bason of silver: 
\v 18 And for the altar of incense refined gold by weight; and gold for the pattern of the chariot of the cherubims, that spread out their wings, and covered the ark of the covenant of the \sc [Lord\sc*]{.smallcaps}. 
\v 19 All this, said David, the \sc [Lord\sc*]{.smallcaps} made me understand in writing by his hand upon me, even all the works of this pattern. 
\v 20 And David said to Solomon his son, Be strong and of good courage, and do it: fear not, nor be dismayed: for the \sc [Lord\sc*]{.smallcaps} God, even my God, will be with thee; he will not fail thee, nor forsake thee, until thou hast finished all the work for the service of the house of the \sc [Lord\sc*]{.smallcaps}. 
\v 21 And, behold, the courses of the priests and the Levites, even they shall be with thee for all the service of the house of God: and there shall be with thee for all manner of workmanship every willing skilful man, for any manner of service: also the princes and all the people will be wholly at thy commandment.
\c 29
\p 
\v 1 Furthermore David the king said unto all the congregation, Solomon my son, whom alone God hath chosen, is yet young and tender, and the work is great: for the palace is not for man, but for the \sc [Lord\sc*]{.smallcaps} God. 
\v 2 Now I have prepared with all my might for the house of my God the gold for things to be made of gold, and the silver for things of silver, and the brass for things of brass, the iron for things of iron, and wood for things of wood; onyx stones, and stones to be set, glistering stones, and of divers colours, and all manner of precious stones, and marble stones in abundance. 
\v 3 Moreover, because I have set my affection to the house of my God, I have of mine own proper good, of gold and silver, which I have given to the house of my God, over and above all that I have prepared for the holy house, 
\v 4 Even three thousand talents of gold, of the gold of Ophir, and seven thousand talents of refined silver, to overlay the walls of the houses withal: 
\v 5 The gold for things of gold, and the silver for things of silver, and for all manner of work to be made by the hands of artificers. And who then is willing to consecrate his service this day unto the \sc [Lord\sc*]{.smallcaps}?\f + \fr 29:5 \ft consecrate his service: Heb. fill his hand \f* 
\p
\v 6 Then the chief of the fathers and princes of the tribes of Israel, and the captains of thousands and of hundreds, with the rulers of the king’s work, offered willingly, 
\v 7 And gave for the service of the house of God of gold five thousand talents and ten thousand drams, and of silver ten thousand talents, and of brass eighteen thousand talents, and one hundred thousand talents of iron. 
\v 8 And they with whom precious stones were found gave them to the treasure of the house of the \sc [Lord\sc*]{.smallcaps}, by the hand of Jehiel the Gershonite. 
\v 9 Then the people rejoiced, for that they offered willingly, because with perfect heart they offered willingly to the \sc [Lord\sc*]{.smallcaps}: and David the king also rejoiced with great joy. 
\p
\v 10 Wherefore David blessed the \sc [Lord\sc*]{.smallcaps} before all the congregation: and David said, Blessed be thou, \sc [Lord\sc*]{.smallcaps} God of Israel our father, for ever and ever. 
\v 11 Thine, O \sc [Lord\sc*]{.smallcaps}, is the greatness, and the power, and the glory, and the victory, and the majesty: for all that is in the heaven and in the earth is thine; thine is the kingdom, O \sc [Lord\sc*]{.smallcaps}, and thou art exalted as head above all. 
\v 12 Both riches and honour come of thee, and thou reignest over all; and in thine hand is power and might; and in thine hand it is to make great, and to give strength unto all. 
\v 13 Now therefore, our God, we thank thee, and praise thy glorious name. 
\v 14 But who am I, and what is my people, that we should be able to offer so willingly after this sort? for all things come of thee, and of thine own have we given thee.\f + \fr 29:14 \ft be able: Heb. retain, or, obtain strength \f* \f + \fr 29:14 \ft of thine…: Heb. of thine hand \f* 
\v 15 For we are strangers before thee, and sojourners, as were all our fathers: our days on the earth are as a shadow, and there is none abiding.\f + \fr 29:15 \ft abiding: Heb. expectation \f* 
\v 16 O \sc [Lord\sc*]{.smallcaps} our God, all this store that we have prepared to build thee an house for thine holy name cometh of thine hand, and is all thine own. 
\v 17 I know also, my God, that thou triest the heart, and hast pleasure in uprightness. As for me, in the uprightness of mine heart I have willingly offered all these things: and now have I seen with joy thy people, which are present here, to offer willingly unto thee.\f + \fr 29:17 \ft present: Heb. found \f* 
\v 18 O \sc [Lord\sc*]{.smallcaps} God of Abraham, Isaac, and of Israel, our fathers, keep this for ever in the imagination of the thoughts of the heart of thy people, and prepare their heart unto thee:\f + \fr 29:18 \ft prepare: or, stablish \f* 
\v 19 And give unto Solomon my son a perfect heart, to keep thy commandments, thy testimonies, and thy statutes, and to do all these things, and to build the palace, for the which I have made provision. 
\p
\v 20 And David said to all the congregation, Now bless the \sc [Lord\sc*]{.smallcaps} your God. And all the congregation blessed the \sc [Lord\sc*]{.smallcaps} God of their fathers, and bowed down their heads, and worshipped the \sc [Lord\sc*]{.smallcaps}, and the king. 
\v 21 And they sacrificed sacrifices unto the \sc [Lord\sc*]{.smallcaps}, and offered burnt offerings unto the \sc [Lord\sc*]{.smallcaps}, on the morrow after that day, even a thousand bullocks, a thousand rams, and a thousand lambs, with their drink offerings, and sacrifices in abundance for all Israel: 
\v 22 And did eat and drink before the \sc [Lord\sc*]{.smallcaps} on that day with great gladness. And they made Solomon the son of David king the second time, and anointed him unto the \sc [Lord\sc*]{.smallcaps} to be the chief governor, and Zadok to be priest. 
\p
\v 23 Then Solomon sat on the throne of the \sc [Lord\sc*]{.smallcaps} as king instead of David his father, and prospered; and all Israel obeyed him. 
\v 24 And all the princes, and the mighty men, and all the sons likewise of king David, submitted themselves unto Solomon the king.\f + \fr 29:24 \ft submitted…: Heb. gave the hand under Solomon \f* 
\v 25 And the \sc [Lord\sc*]{.smallcaps} magnified Solomon exceedingly in the sight of all Israel, and bestowed upon him such royal majesty as had not been on any king before him in Israel. 
\p
\v 26 Thus David the son of Jesse reigned over all Israel. 
\v 27 And the time that he reigned over Israel was forty years; seven years reigned he in Hebron, and thirty and three years reigned he in Jerusalem. 
\v 28 And he died in a good old age, full of days, riches, and honour: and Solomon his son reigned in his stead. 
\v 29 Now the acts of David the king, first and last, behold, they are written in the book of Samuel the seer, and in the book of Nathan the prophet, and in the book of Gad the seer,\f + \fr 29:29 \ft book: or, history: Heb. words \f* 
\v 30 With all his reign and his might, and the times that went over him, and over Israel, and over all the kingdoms of the countries.
